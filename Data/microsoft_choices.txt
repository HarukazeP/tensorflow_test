I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are { crying ### instantaneously ### residing ### matched ### walking } alone in London.
It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged { daintily ### privately ### inadvertently ### miserably ### comfortably } in every nook and corner.
As I descended , my old ally , the { gods ### moon ### panther ### guard ### country-dance } , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
We got off , { rubbing ### doubling ### paid ### naming ### carrying } our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
He held in his hand a { supply ### parcel ### sign ### sheet ### chorus } of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures.
Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his { balloon ### stick ### niece ### beard ### suit } two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked.
There is no { understanding ### communication ### difference ### intrigue ### issue } between them , but they all open out into the same corridor.
He and I seemed to be the only living things between the { funniest ### speedy ### huge ### actual ### judicial } arch of the sky and the desert beneath it.
It may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little { taller ### farmhouse ### curious ### brook ### pale } , is it not.
Twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting { silently ### intermittently ### unconsciously ### knowingly ### elsewhere } for whatever might befall.
She never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and { telephoned ### begged ### kissed ### helped ### robbed } me to tell no one what had happened.
A few faint { tragedies ### stars ### rumours ### noises ### explanations } were gleaming in a violet sky.
I tell you that he is a { venerable ### delicate ### glorious ### clever ### sweet } and dangerous man.
I can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three { batters ### cheers ### centuries ### fiddlers ### chimes } from a neighboring clock.
My friend was an enthusiastic { cobbler ### advocate ### musician ### cow ### highwayman } , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.
I should like to have his { share ### prospect ### opinion ### portrait ### paroxysm } of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done.
He shook hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was { unable ### accustomed ### beginning ### forced ### anxious } to hear his story.
A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he { sprang ### dared ### resigned ### sought ### stooped } to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
I went up to the house with the { Moonstone ### moonlight ### empire ### asylum ### Inspector } , and saw all that was to be seen.
I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary { confinement ### meditation ### watcher ### carriers ### island } , and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs.
It swelled up louder and louder , a { worn-out ### weak ### mere ### hoarse ### wholesome } yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.
Whatever his crimes , he has { suffered ### touched ### taught ### forgotten ### eaten } something to atone for them.
You can imagine my { virtue ### seamanship ### occupation ### exultation ### ankles } , Watson , when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground.
The butler brought me my { entrance ### affairs ### coffee ### pickle ### nose } into the library , and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.
The maid had loved the { porch ### wayside ### yam ### butler ### automobiles } , but had afterwards had cause to hate him.
He hammered loudly at the { whelps ### knocker ### barn ### tumult ### vegetables } and pulled at the bell , but without any success.
It was several miles off , but I could { regularly ### darkly ### scarcely ### distinctly ### possibly } see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray.
This , of course , fitted in well enough with the { mystic ### inevitable ### police ### customary ### dreary } theory , if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him.
The chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as I { leaned ### glanced ### crawled ### stepped ### rode } across it told me of its richness.
The J. P shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own { downfall ### abilities ### symptoms ### chamber ### government } , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room.
I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a { commonplace ### confirmed ### lovely ### formidable ### younger } man a man who might play a deep game.
Besides , I can read in a man's eye when it is his own { hypothesis ### misfortunes ### opinion ### skin ### foreboding } that he is frightened for.
The boards round and the { merits ### shadow ### panelling ### smell ### splintering } of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.
Miss Hunter screamed and { shrunk ### marched ### hissed ### breathed ### supported } against the wall at the sight of him , but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
This second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by { valor ### universities ### bedsteads ### degrees ### servants } , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.
Was he our { consecrated ### pedantic ### malignant ### cheerful ### splendid } enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel.
As we ran towards it the vague outline { wandered ### backed ### separated ### hardened ### folded } into a definite shape.
Holmes pulled a large sheet of { defiance ### varnish ### tissue-paper ### iron ### carpet } out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee.
Then I carefully { brushed ### stripped ### wiped ### shut ### paced } off five to the east and two to the south.
The instant that we heard it , Holmes { sprang ### mellowed ### floated ### swelled ### disappeared } from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
He lay back without { ceremony ### control ### pity ### wincing ### enthusiasm } , though he bit his lip from time to time.
I went at once to my room and drew up my { nurture ### resolution ### report ### opportunity ### tumult } of the morning's conversation for Holmes.
Having once made up my mind , you know the { hopelessness ### correspondence ### astonishment ### spell ### steps } which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.
I shall give directions that you may { remain ### ride ### throb ### step ### billow } behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked.
It may be that the solution of the one may { prove ### choose ### learn ### forget ### succumb } to be the solution of the other.
They say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the { cup ### note ### sleepers ### forester ### fugitive } from their beds.
Fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have { located ### encumbered ### traversed ### drawn ### contained } the gossips away from this four-year-old drama.
Again and again I have taken a problem to him , and have received an { arrangement ### affliction ### invitation ### entanglement ### explanation } which has afterwards proved to be the correct one.
There he is , all { pale ### dirty ### safe ### blood-stained ### crooked } and sound.
He actually sat { adrift ### smiling ### comfortably ### crying ### sewing } in an arm-chair , and I could hardly get him to speak coherently.
My mistress told me that you were { terrifying ### running ### written ### likely ### attached } to call.
It was one of the main arteries which { supported ### surrounded ### sheltered ### conveyed ### contained } the traffic of the City to the north and west.
I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the { oath ### message ### blame ### shirt ### shadows } upon myself.
He had a very dark , { rosy ### childish ### fearsome ### colorless ### yellow } face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams.
The fat man { cast ### folded ### hastened ### jingled ### winked } his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight.
We passed up the stair , { devoured ### translated ### unlocked ### ascended ### occupied } the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.
Holmes was for the moment as { startled ### tired ### thin ### wise ### clever } as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.
The chimney is wide , but is { torn ### softened ### higher ### barred ### constantly } up by four large staples.
My companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat { closed ### slouched ### wheeled ### pulled ### blown } down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought.
He used to make { progress ### matters ### merry ### advances ### rules } over the cleverness of women , but I have not heard him do it of late.
I have { determined ### related ### overheard ### absconded ### noticed } , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.
As I passed out through the wicket gate , however , I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the { battle ### chamber ### incubator ### shadow ### spring } upon the other side.
A low { courtship ### struggle ### blow ### shrub ### moan } had fallen upon our ears.
I realized it as I { sailed ### smiled ### drove ### shrunk ### flowed } back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.
You must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we { behold ### realised ### provide ### lose ### owe } this table and chair.
I hope to { heaven ### explain ### argue ### inhabit ### demand } that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here.
It threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the { shadows ### thicket ### rushes ### potage ### field } beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall.
Perhaps our { gate ### weather ### visit ### limbs ### skirts } now may do something to make it less obscure.
That was bad enough , for all that the { garret ### saints ### dog ### coroner ### birds } said.
He had heard nothing , and the { affair ### devil ### snow ### challenge ### illusion } remained a complete mystery.
Then he { vanished ### bent ### leant ### wept ### hovered } over the hill.
Not a { scoundrel ### muddle ### soldier ### whim ### whisper } , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped.
I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to { pawn ### contradict ### invoke ### store ### subdue } it.
I sat down upon a { keg ### sword ### farm ### fly ### needle } in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over.
The inspector hurried away on the instant to make { songs ### pleasantries ### mistakes ### stories ### inquiries } about the page , while Holmes and I returned to Baker Street for breakfast.
She could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what { sport ### indirect ### handsome ### imprudence ### comfort } or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
When his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as { formidable ### loud ### quick ### tall ### invisible } as that with which we had started.
The back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the { forest ### parties ### victory ### stairs ### mills } he saw two men wrestling together outside.
I read nothing except the criminal { courage ### peace ### news ### nuts ### plans } and the agony column.
I confess that they quite { visited ### enjoyed ### lightened ### emptied ### surpass } my expectations , and that I am utterly unable to account for your result.
Was there a police-station { lying ### rolling ### gathered ### anywhere ### comin' } near.
I do not think that I have ever seen so { accurate ### numerous ### thin ### provocative ### marked } a man.
It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was { resounding ### sleeping ### beheaded ### running ### growing } on the inside of it.
I don't think I ever { choked ### suspected ### drove ### remembered ### conceived } faster , but the others were there before us.
I have tried to { recommend ### fling ### accomplish ### reconstruct ### carry } it from the measurements.
I am sorry to have { killed ### convinced ### practised ### expected ### interrupted } you.
At the end were the { signatures ### relics ### hearts ### anxieties ### portraits } of the high dignitaries who had signed it.
My companion noiselessly { toed ### awaited ### grasped ### closed ### mounted } the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room.
The darkness was { rising ### healed ### ponderous ### neglected ### attractive } , but much was still hidden by the shadows.
I was pained at the { mistake ### porch ### fireplace ### ceiling ### pump } , for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind.
We had come out upon Oxford Street and I had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to Kensington , when my words were { arrested ### startled ### enriched ### perplexed ### benumbed } by the extraordinary conduct of my companion.
When I thought of the heavy { step ### sandwiches ### breathing ### rains ### boxes } and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode.
When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to { assure ### detach ### teach ### dismiss ### reproach } him that she would be back before very long.
Was she his { discomfiture ### client ### choice ### musings ### opportunity } , his friend , or his mistress.
We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the { image ### clatter ### baying ### tinkle ### click } of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to.
A collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be { incomplete ### considered ### audible ### discovered ### disembowelled } which contained no account of this very singular business.
His hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and { chattering ### picturesque ### hopeful ### puckered ### glistening } like a withered apple.
The point is a simple one , but the Inspector had { detected ### baked ### touched ### rendered ### overlooked } it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter.
He went over to the door , and turning the { lamp ### fish ### lock ### bucket ### boulder } he examined it in his methodical way.
My heart { cruised ### lies ### lingered ### leaped ### struggled } within me as I saw it.
Another day two at the most and I have my case { moaning ### arose ### complete ### tonight ### mechanically } , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child.
Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton , and , { pulling ### cautioning ### addressing ### touching ### approaching } me not to speak , he led the way into the hall.
The lake there is eight feet deep , and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the { trail ### descendants ### rectitude ### outburst ### destruction } of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it.
Four or five minutes afterwards the { angry ### sitting-room ### typical ### monotonous ### ironic } window will open.
I rushed out , { muttering ### marvelling ### calling ### sighing ### fluttering } loudly for my stepfather , and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.
The coachman saw him { neglect ### strike ### cross ### adjust ### grasp } the hall and enter it.
He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft { juicy ### humming ### missing ### cloth ### shimmering } cap which he had laid down upon my books.
More than one person { fainted ### delivered ### stayed ### knocked ### snarled } at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect.
The smarting of it { delighted ### ends ### recalled ### fled ### arrived } in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.
It came out upon the { sidewalk ### cloth ### landing ### bench ### mountain } opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall.
Then he { mopped ### reseated ### lashed ### shut ### committed } himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.
Twice they tried to get at him and { creaked ### withered ### reigned ### failed ### fought } ; a third time , you see , it came off.
Joseph Harrison is my name , and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I shall at least be a { penitent ### revolution ### peasant ### queen ### relation } by marriage.
They all agreed that only two { chairs ### logs ### voices ### foxes ### decanters } were to be heard , those of Barclay and of his wife.
The skylight above was open , and the { prisoner ### actions ### holiday ### laws ### plantation } gone.
His grandfather was a royal { bounty ### race ### palace ### duke ### concubine } , and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.
You must { contradict ### persuade ### cover ### lock ### judge } yourself up from him to-night.
Already I was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a { variety ### gush ### bunch ### pair ### branch } of hope back to my heart.
Mortimer had { stayed ### submitted ### sunk ### risen ### spoken } to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards.
Holmes had brought up a long thin { hedge ### cane ### dilemma ### nose ### pickle } , and this he placed upon the bed beside him.
My sister and I , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how { determined ### superstitious ### insignificant ### violent ### subtle } are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.
The stage lost a fine { estate ### actor ### horseman ### hunter ### linguist } , even as science lost an acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime.
For days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been { slain ### published ### packed ### sunk ### burnt } in the deepest gloom.
There was a long silence , during which Holmes { thrust ### leaned ### removed ### tossed ### nodded } his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
We were in time to { overtake ### cultivate ### reunite ### analyse ### deluge } the major before he reached the corner.
He said a few words to each candidate as he came up , and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would { teach ### join ### disqualify ### hinder ### mock } them.
He was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than { satisfied ### thankful ### forty ### thirteen ### likely } now.
It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money , and that it is still { prevalent ### warm ### loud ### lying ### believed } in our cellar.
I've always been { transported ### hanging ### deposited ### proud ### drawn } above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me.
But , you know , I have been trained as an { Elephant ### actress ### excuse ### aeroplane ### exercise } myself.
Perhaps , Mr. Wilson , you would have the great kindness to { outlast ### reward ### recommence ### interrupt ### spoil } your narrative.
Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his { consent ### friendship ### hopes ### pocket-book ### tools } and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well.
We had reached the same crowded { creek ### sepulchre ### thoroughfare ### clergy ### theatres } in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips , at the point of my { misfortune ### luck ### punishment ### revolver ### salvation } if necessary , who he was and why he had dogged us so long.
During two years I have had three { crackers ### fishes ### jackets ### cheers ### consultations } and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.
How he did it I could not { swallow ### imagine ### worry ### exclaim ### move } , but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd , and right up to the steps which led to the office.
Her face fell , however , when she saw that I was a { baby ### madman ### picnic ### stranger ### visitor } , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.
To do this was quite beyond my power , and I could only hope that by { torture ### sunset ### excavation ### pondering ### economy } I might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate.
Presently he emerged , looking even more { numerous ### unprofitable ### instructive ### flurried ### reassuring } than before.
He took a small piece of torn paper from a { groan ### pencil ### picnic ### flag ### note-book } and spread it out upon his knee.
He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as { maid ### executrix ### relative ### ballast ### guide } to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels.
It was absolutely certain , therefore , in spite of her { denial ### caste ### misfortune ### honour ### unhappiness } , that she must know something of the matter.
The walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when I came to examine it I could see a { drop ### couple ### crust ### condensation ### series } of metallic deposit all over it.
The barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the { glory ### fame ### mystery ### hammer ### driveway } and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart.
There was something that touched me as I read this letter , something { naked ### substantial ### egotistic ### pitiable ### mysterious } in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes.
I understand that it was on a { plain ### professional ### holiday ### recognized ### founded } matter that you wished to speak to me.
He was { educated ### thin ### calm ### mumbling ### clever } and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind.
He is as brave as a { candle ### knife ### apron ### bulldog ### motor-car } and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
I want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be { charmed ### safe ### forced ### explained ### defeated } away.
He may have been { misinformed ### abroad ### overheard ### asleep ### innocent } , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out.
My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were { pressed ### blocked ### accompanied ### united ### overcome } by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night.
I read death on his face as plain as I can read that { text ### bacon ### infantry ### rope ### tube } over the fire.
In the last century , however , four successive { heirs ### workers ### singers ### rebels ### prisoners } were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.
Between your brandy and your { distress ### bandage ### innocence ### permission ### oaths } , I feel a new man.
I did not { reappear ### gain ### cook ### remain ### begin } very much , however , by my inspection.
Naturally , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately I had no { bargain ### offence ### capital ### embarrassment ### assertion } by which I could do this.
They were all three standing in a { monastery ### drawing-room ### knot ### fortress ### nest } in front of the altar.
Holmes had sat up upon the couch , and I saw him { grinning ### lie ### travel ### motion ### sing } like a man who is in need of air.
It was quite certain that he had { resumed ### pawned ### foreseen ### mislaid ### improved } his fate , and that it had caused him the utmost horror.
And when he { hears ### wakes ### speaks ### wishes ### wrote } of Irene Adler , or when he refers to her photograph , it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
How quiet and sweet and { confused ### opposite ### wholesome ### distressing ### blinding } the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down.
You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the { tower ### torrent ### lake ### sheet ### merchants } from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer.
The lamps had been { cleaned ### banished ### disturbed ### lit ### misinformed } , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.
As I set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with { fog ### shame ### writing ### snow ### cigarettes } upon it.
With much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly { good-natured ### mangled ### well-spoken ### intelligent ### unchristian } , into the house.
There is something in it which { befel ### possesses ### employs ### fed ### fascinates } me extremely.
Mr. Alec , however , was a { first-class ### dangerous ### good-hearted ### sensible ### clever } man to play games of that sort with.
But , first , as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room , I think that I shall help myself to a { lump ### dash ### bar ### picture ### piece } of your brandy , Colonel.
In his hand he held a { holiday ### pistol ### wolf ### soldier ### dressing-table } , but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced.
There is no possibility of a secret door , and the { books ### clerks ### windows ### meadows ### novices } are quite thirty feet from the ground.
For three hours we strolled about together , { filling ### retaining ### leaving ### watching ### arranging } the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet Street and the Strand.
So interested was he that I had to { repeat ### undo ### steal ### buy ### invent } some of it twice before he was satisfied.
You can understand that , living the life which I have { described ### concluded ### arrived ### avoided ### conceded } , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.
Is that a place where a { Canadian ### breeze ### creature ### government ### shepherd } would be likely to take his station.
A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which { ascended ### goes ### sprang ### stooped ### sufficed } to show me that he was fully dressed.
I thought the matter over , and I came to the conclusion that I must { draw ### burn ### strike ### approach ### remove } the case from another aspect.
It's not been { built ### slain ### invaluable ### formed ### fed } for two days.
He has died within ten { seconds ### degrees ### grains ### drops ### conditions } of being bitten.
It contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two { pairs ### books ### bottles ### drops ### tins } of preserved peaches.
The bottle was { painted ### quartered ### downstairs ### published ### interested } in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , I ran down to get it.
I should be very much obliged if you would { slip ### increase ### pull ### enlarge ### appreciate } your revolver into your pocket.
I had no { difficulty ### hesitation ### faith ### scruple ### luck } in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed.
The metal work was in the form of a double ring , but it had been bent and { wriggled ### twisted ### faded ### poured ### marched } out of its original shape.
She knows that the King is { minded ### dying ### devoid ### pitiless ### capable } of having her waylaid and searched.
I had no idea of the { cliffs ### lengths ### needle ### eunuchs ### newspaper } to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.
But I understand , Holmes , that you are turning to practical ends those { violets ### losers ### barbarians ### powers ### loans } with which you used to amaze us.
Mr. Cunningham , looking out of his { bedroom ### reign ### productions ### danger ### captivity } , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once.
Then it { flowed ### waded ### flashed ### strolled ### floated } through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it.
We had reached Pall Mall as we { trembled ### slept ### applauded ### reeled ### talked } , and were walking down it from the St. James's end.
It was a { mere ### reckless ### helpless ### wonderfully ### woman's } silent house.
When it was concluded he settled our new { torments ### acquaintance ### moon ### rage ### dishes } upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.
It would indeed be a { message ### pity ### match ### companion ### triumph } for me if I could run him to earth where my master had failed.
Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission , and without the { outbreak ### indifference ### payment ### authority ### countenance } which was my due.
I beg you to remember that no one knows where you are , and that , whether you are in this carriage or in my house , you are { manufactured ### interested ### celebrated ### equally ### engaged } in my power.
I was { weary ### aware ### ignorant ### conscious ### independent } of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced.
Then he turned the handle and entered , I at his heels , with the { lazy ### proudest ### cocked ### muddled ### coral } pistol in my hand.
I gave a { trifle ### coward ### hurry ### kitchen ### rock } myself.
So far I could { waste ### follow ### bury ### lose ### ensure } their actions as if I had actually seen them.
If he is { violent ### petty ### extraneous ### nourishing ### funny } , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow.
Shortly after our return to England my mother died she was { born ### dispatched ### riding ### praying ### killed } eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe.
Major Murphy , to whom I owe most of my { neck ### beauty ### facts ### pockets ### folly } , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.
Admiration was , I { obeyed ### shouted ### repeat ### gasped ### argued } , the first impression.
We should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks Greek and who began these { individuals ### negotiations ### outcasts ### spurs ### sentiments } has been forced to return to the East.
On reaching Scotland Yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and comply with the legal { obstacles ### acuteness ### formalities ### disputes ### restraints } which would enable us to enter the house.
My nets are { impotent ### closing ### written ### books ### expressions } upon him , even as his are upon Sir Henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy.
Then you hand over to me three quarters of what you { dry ### refuse ### earn ### heed ### infer } , and you keep the other quarter for yourself.
I observe that there is a good deal of German { spies ### arguments ### apples ### gilt ### music } on the programme , which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.
We compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without { discussing ### revealing ### considering ### hearing ### telling } what they are.
This also was opened , and led down a flight of winding stone { pitchers ### flags ### steps ### edifice ### balconies } , which terminated at another formidable gate.
There were a thousand { worlds ### obstacles ### offerings ### lives ### duels } to save , but it was of only one that I was thinking when I dropped over the wall that night.
But there is , if you will { excuse ### satisfy ### blast ### criticize ### receive } my saying so , something just a little funny about it.
On his evidence Cartwright was { discovered ### ruffled ### overhead ### confused ### hanged } and the other three got fifteen years apiece.
Far away stretched a line of { emperors ### bamboos ### chivalry ### cookies ### houses } , with a light here and there in the upper windows.
An hour and half had { spoken ### glittered ### floated ### arrived ### elapsed } before the Inspector returned alone.
These articles , with two small { wine ### wicker-work ### lighted ### walking ### massive } chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.
At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a { piece ### thrill ### trace ### source ### prospect } of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met.
Finally he walked over to the bed and { hired ### ordered ### spent ### gathered ### offered } some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.
Indeed , it was almost { mesmeric ### humdrum ### unfounded ### pedestrian ### deferential } , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek.
The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which I had the { privilege ### aspect ### indignation ### magnitude ### integrity } of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods.
And , first , one or two { stations ### matches ### robberies ### campaigns ### questions } , Mr. Wilson.
It was the most { horrible ### dangerous ### degrading ### preposterous ### important } position in which I ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.
Left his { defeat ### impudence ### finger ### lodgings ### affairs } at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since.
So much is { fairly ### singing ### falling ### reared ### setting } clear.
I really had not the { bark ### aeroplane ### comfort ### energy ### preference } to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation.
The matter was so { bewildered ### dumfounded ### prearranged ### astonished ### intense } that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows.
Finally , with a shamefaced apology for his { civility ### bravery ### weakness ### kindness ### benevolence } , he rose once more.
In order to { remonstrate ### weep ### harmonize ### perish ### negotiate } with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this Mr. Melas , having used some other one before.
I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand , and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the { pocket ### bosom ### custody ### middle ### shade } of his dressing-gown.
I came away { baffled ### kicking ### grinning ### rosy ### rumbling } and disheartened.
I stared at it { rapidly ### horror-stricken ### forever ### afterwards ### lightly } , not knowing what was about to issue from it.
Far away we could hear the deep { stillness ### horror ### tones ### shadow ### breathing } of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour.
Upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular { list ### variety ### club ### mixture ### gush } of hard carved wood with a bone handle.
Her rich { leaves ### tints ### armor ### cloth ### sauce } made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast.
On the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after { breakfast ### listening ### aspiring ### fidgeting ### muttering } to receive my instructions for the day.
I had come to believe that he was an { artist ### aristocrat ### Irishman ### officer ### orphan } with no relatives living , but one day , to my very great surprise , he began to talk to me about his brother.
This girl had been { devoted ### permitted ### pleased ### addressed ### alluded } to him.
Between ourselves , I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his { illness ### whiskers ### pony ### glasses ### grave } yet.
An instant later I heard him running down , and he { burst ### stepped ### sank ### climbed ### slipped } into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic.
I know something , Sir Henry , and perhaps I should have said it before , but it was long after the { stuff ### inquest ### books ### retort ### path } that I found it out.
With a stout { stick ### staff ### battle-cry ### bearing ### walking-stick } , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess , I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was.
The Colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the { scene ### exhortations ### smell ### majesty ### commencement } of the tragedy.
I have already { shouted ### sneered ### arranged ### bought ### consulted } what is to occur.
His slippers , too , were gone , but his { feelings ### circumstances ### impulses ### looks ### boots } were left behind.
The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room , but hearing that his wife had returned he { deserted ### invoked ### joined ### loosened ### pressed } her in the morning-room.
Together we { rolled ### whirled ### swelled ### rushed ### withdrew } into the room.
Who were these German people , and what were they doing living in this strange , { infallible ### impossible ### out-of-the-way ### unladylike ### untimely } place.
Having done this , he drew up the windows on each side , and I found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to { preserve ### prevent ### excuse ### justify ### alleviate } my seeing through them.
A depleted bank account had caused me to { pursue ### prolong ### direct ### postpone ### arrange } my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.
Have your { stomach ### pistol ### honour ### tea ### creature } ready in case we should need it.
He is not a bad fellow , though an absolute { difficulty ### faith ### experience ### contradiction ### imbecile } in his profession.
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had { killed ### breakfasted ### transpired ### noticed ### wandered } during the day.
The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the { moist ### magical ### nocturnal ### superior ### family's } earth.
The bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she { conceived ### eased ### stripped ### approved ### complained } of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
To rake this up couldn't help our poor master , and it's well to go { downstairs ### astray ### carefully ### yesterday ### downhill } when there's a lady in the case.
For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other { phrase ### veil ### dignity ### orthography ### clue } which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor.
Every day , and sometimes { giving ### finding ### requiring ### twice ### representing } a day , I have been able but wait a moment , Dr. Watson.
He came himself to live with me in the character of a { resident ### prompt ### wealthy ### timid ### speculative } patient.
I had been casting round for some { excuse ### training ### passage ### stairs ### timidity } by which I could get away from his gossip , but now I began to wish to hear more of it.
The point is of the utmost { importance ### recklessness ### capacity ### accommodation ### exertion } as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel.
My morning's work has not been { wasted ### deliberate ### neglected ### invisible ### overlooked } , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.
It was a quarter-past { nine ### sixteen ### thirty-five ### seconds ### nineteen } when I started from home and made my way across the Park , and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
I should be { addressed ### compared ### compelled ### insensible ### wedded } to stop the night.
Yet it was quite certain , from the { stupid ### absolute ### whizzing ### biggest ### historic } stillness , that we were in the country.
No doubt his blackmailing case is { inside ### producing ### gleaming ### leaving ### absorbing } all his faculties.
There were several people on the { sofa ### news ### pavement ### horizon ### ocean } at the time , but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
This we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our { hearts ### lives ### meetings ### situation ### operations } we erected a hydraulic press.
The rapidity with which such a { saint ### contest ### revolution ### poison ### fool } would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage.
Even after I became suspicious , I found it hard to think { evil ### kindly ### custody ### highly ### previously } of such a dear , kind old clergyman.
The smoke and { small-pox ### packages ### shouting ### literature ### umbrellas } were enough to shake nerves of steel.
It was { equal ### contrary ### quarter ### indispensable ### useless } to twelve when the alarm broke out.
Then he tried the { various ### cheap ### largest ### king's ### mixed } keys in the lock , but without success.
Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word , for about one o'clock he { defied ### poisoned ### befriended ### rejoined ### pressed } us in the Colonel's smoking-room.
You may not be aware that the { collection ### sagacity ### absence ### deduction ### exercise } of a man's age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts.
Several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as I hold here , were { scattered ### tilting ### leaning ### sailing ### passing } over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else.
The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton , as our { aroma ### government ### conscience ### engagement ### client } is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.
To me at least there was a strange { choice ### contrast ### union ### confusion ### comfort } between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.
You may believe , then , that I was in my { school ### consulting-room ### memory ### baggage ### childhood } when , at the appointed hour , the page showed in the patient.
Suddenly , as I looked , he rose from his chair , and { bringing ### falling ### walking ### crouching ### growing } over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers.
I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay , and I { act ### agree ### danced ### tremble ### interview } with you that he is at the head of his profession.
Come , now , we shall see who { agrees ### planned ### wrought ### bound ### tittered } with you.
Holmes took a { pinch ### notion ### cup ### member ### bundle } of papers from his pocket.
I stood { crowded ### uptown ### accommodated ### dumb ### dripping } with astonishment , watching him from the darkness.
The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by { meeting ### sending ### permitting ### Sherlock ### telling } Holmes as we travelled back next day.
Holmes cut the { trails ### oaks ### bread ### knives ### cord } and removed the transverse bar.
He had usually a great many { cities ### apologies ### letters ### voices ### snares } , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him.
He was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect { priest ### knight ### lad ### maiden ### demon } , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver.
I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of { heads ### parents ### Scripture ### centers ### territories } by studying their children.
It was a { good-humoured ### quick ### regular ### homely ### witty } little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses.
One morning , at a little before seven o'clock , I was { tortured ### awakened ### recalled ### protected ### pursued } by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room.
The boy was { assigned ### nowhere ### speaking ### pleasant ### condemned } to be seen.
With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he { hesitated ### arose ### smoked ### escaped ### begged } and then came back.
We have { replaced ### provided ### qualified ### deceived ### reminded } him with all that he can want.
But that is a { longish ### mere ### reproachful ### romantic ### newborn } detail.
Within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very { hot ### massive ### printed ### French ### unlucky } iron gate.
But I want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their { object ### fate ### valor ### liberty ### territory } was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me.
These infernal people seem to think that there are no { tidings ### pictures ### chances ### stacks ### rights } of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles.
A terrible scream a { prolonged ### girlish ### breathless ### drowsy ### wonderful } yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor.
Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a { trance ### carriage ### gallop ### trot ### fountain } , the door of which was standing open.
It was { agreeable ### fatal ### incredible ### inferior ### essential } to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be.
They meet , they write , there is a complete { understanding ### problem ### conversation ### repose ### explanation } between them.
The policeman and I agreed that our best plan would be to { seize ### abhor ### disobey ### relinquish ### sting } the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them.
He was acutely uneasy if he were { absent ### propagated ### falling ### pouring ### distinguished } from her for a day.
He had { soaked ### performed ### spotted ### imbibed ### released } the place.
It was a { moon ### quarter ### prolonged ### mere ### century } past six when we left Baker Street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.
It may { flourish ### kiss ### trust ### purify ### stop } his gossip.
I am still so weak that I have to { rise ### eat ### drink ### rustle ### write } , as you see , by dictating.
Then Sherlock Holmes { pulled ### bowed ### tumbled ### tore ### peered } down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.
For half an hour I sat with { straining ### widened ### bent ### closed ### extended } ears.
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in { inventing ### engaging ### digging ### erecting ### opening } a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.
Holmes walked slowly round and { examined ### relieved ### embraced ### promised ### liked } each and all of them with the keenest interest.
Miss Irene , or Madame , rather , { returns ### stirred ### leaned ### glared ### shot } from her drive at seven.
Why should she fight against every { taste ### job ### admission ### coast ### experiment } until it was forced from her.
I see him every day through my { knobs ### compass ### doubts ### fingers ### telescope } upon the roof.
The servants { remembered ### liked ### grinned ### recollected ### deny } having seen it before , but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked.
Still , of course , if you would like to { linger ### sing ### draw ### hang ### wear } out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so.
This man strikes even { honest ### indifference ### smaller ### cleaner ### deeper } , but I think , Watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still.
You remember the small { strip ### bunches ### piece ### quantity ### affair } of Uriah and Bathsheba.
For a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical { mistake ### debate ### organization ### wound ### establishment } in my calculations.
The sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the { example ### spoils ### loop ### crack ### rights } of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.
I say normal cases , because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the { reign ### signs ### splendour ### offspring ### first-fruits } of old age , even when the invalid is a youth.
Hayter was a fine old { hypocrite ### lass ### soldier ### fool ### dog } who had seen much of the world , and he soon found , as I had expected , that Holmes and he had much in common.
I tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any { disagreement ### witch ### cake ### crack ### imprudence } or crevice.
I had been told that if the King employed an { uproar ### agent ### experience ### existence ### institution } it would certainly be you.
What is to me a means of { transport ### livelihood ### eating ### reverence ### amusement } is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante.
Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the { flat ### clearest ### windless ### breathing ### nearest } night.
He came up to my room one morning , and { plunged ### floundered ### crept ### glimmered ### rambled } into business in an instant.
Naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook , and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the { ignorance ### dispute ### element ### sword ### astonishment } which was still raging.
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small { fresh-water ### boiled ### hay ### traveling ### sliding } shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter.
Holmes flung open the door and { bided ### peered ### dissolved ### peeped ### rushed } in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat.
The woman's story hung coherently together , and all my { troubles ### questions ### senses ### limbs ### clothes } were unable to shake it.
Now , this puts a very { temperamental ### offensive ### business-like ### powerful ### meaningless } weapon into our hands.
Altogether , look as I would , there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head , and the expression of { impatient ### mocking ### perpetual ### reckless ### extreme } chagrin and discontent upon his features.
It was a { misty ### gray ### cloudy ### perfect ### lucky } day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.
The firemen had been much { relieved ### thwarted ### amused ### perturbed ### flattered } at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
Too large for easy { familiarity ### concealment ### conversation ### traveling ### confidences } about a woman's dress.
Finally he took the { bell-rope ### hole ### reins ### key ### document } in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
I was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy { elm-tree ### waiter ### porter ### peon ### audience } with a lantern.
All we wish you to do is to { destroy ### repeat ### confound ### examine ### cross } the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.
Then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his { spirits ### senses ### pillow ### knees ### chest } until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins.
When you { recall ### resemble ### raise ### surrender ### reconsider } your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
Well , there is nothing very { faint ### limited ### instructive ### unfrequent ### punctual } in all this.
Sitting in the { fortune ### billiard-room ### future ### summer ### cradle } I more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion.
The manor-house is , as I have already said , very old , and only one { machine ### object ### wing ### beloved ### tomb } is now inhabited.
We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our { pools ### resources ### coffee ### honour ### statesmen } and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.
I caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within { leaving ### studying ### supporting ### assuring ### regarding } them that it was a false alarm.
His hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the { secrets ### bosom ### marks ### spouse ### fate } of a violent blow.
I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but the coachman had come in , and as he was { recognising ### carrying ### coaxing ### watching ### drawing } me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.
Now , of course that { effected ### stirred ### chanced ### suggested ### occurred } at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.
I saw in the gaslight that Holmes { smote ### wore ### imparted ### uttered ### devised } an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine.
They were { defeated ### astonished ### terrified ### accelerated ### admitted } by a confederate inside the house.
The animal has been { baptized ### granted ### sultry ### achieved ### moving } , and we have the length of its stride.
I slept at Baker Street that night , and we were { riding ### strolling ### engaged ### forced ### hanged } upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
He had been dead some days , but there was no { discipline ### wound ### joy ### food ### reward } or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end.
Over the wide { chimney ### winter ### Pacific ### planks ### expanse } there was no sound and no movement.
I shall be happy to give you an { apology ### attack ### economist ### opinion ### injury } upon the subject in the course of a day or two.
We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his { breast ### throne ### knees ### pedestal ### haunches } , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets.
The machine goes readily enough , but there is some stiffness in the { fervour ### shape ### majesty ### habit ### working } of it , and it has lost a little of its force.
Then they will not { pick ### lose ### hurt ### strike ### earn } a minute , for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.
I told the police last time they did it that they should { stop ### shave ### develop ### hire ### interrogate } these disgraceful exhibitions.
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash { dragged ### hung ### poured ### seized ### chewing } on one corner of the bed.
I was still rather { eloquent ### drunk ### ordinary ### tight ### raw } over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind.
Nor would it be entirely { incompatible ### combined ### illuminated ### blanched ### covered } with most of the words overhead.
That is my room at the end of the { cliff ### stairs ### rapids ### ocean ### water-side } , and my son's is the one beyond it.
But the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not { confined ### ventured ### sufficient ### destined ### worthy } to fall into the hands of justice.
This incident gives zest to our investigation , however , and I only { recall ### propose ### assert ### forget ### trust } that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.
I have told you that she had only recently recovered from an { agreement ### earthquake ### illness ### error ### infant } , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being at work.
With tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , I sat in the dark recess of the hut and { breakfasted ### danced ### waited ### fought ### smiled } with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.
Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural { curiosity ### enemy ### habit ### feelings ### instinct } , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured.
In two hours we must be on the { scene ### crest ### shores ### price ### banks } of action.
I was tortured and tried to get away , and was { polite ### nurtured ### laughing ### captured ### punctilious } and tortured again.
It had set , according to their account , into the most { delicate ### sublime ### genteel ### tender ### dreadful } expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming.
After throwing down your paper , which was the { action ### residue ### theory ### sword ### judgment } which drew my attention to you , you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression.
My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her { wit's ### inborn ### wilder ### well-merited ### obstinate } end.
There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to { raise ### join ### omit ### destroy ### soften } the bar.
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a { contrary ### gentle ### laborious ### lower ### painful } slope , thickening into a grove at the highest point.
He could only say that if I { waited ### hoped ### slept ### believed ### reasoned } I should hear by post.
The fault from what I hear may not have been { entirely ### reflected ### erected ### expended ### committed } on one side.
A frayed top-hat and a { swollen ### faded ### remarkably ### tender ### wavering } brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
We took no { fault ### permission ### pains ### fidelity ### instructions } to hide it.
A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight , and Mrs. Barclay had { stooped ### driven ### prevailed ### hurried ### ridden } over her dinner in order to be present at it.
I began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener { retribution ### faculties ### pronunciation ### impudence ### shingles } that he did himself.
One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is { examined ### passing ### charmed ### shouted ### preached } into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic.
It was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of exercising { enormous ### actual ### original ### hardware ### average } pressure.
Holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the { honour ### architecture ### rays ### clump ### sons } of the house.
By it he laid the { box ### smell ### possibilities ### condition ### mouths } of matches and the stump of a candle.
The lawn is thirty yards across , and is only { visible ### divided ### redeemed ### advanced ### suffering } from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.
Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the { edge ### convocation ### workmanship ### shores ### lapse } of the table.
Your right hand is quite a size { higher ### sadder ### harder ### sooner ### larger } than your left.
The wind was howling outside , and the rain was beating and { splashing ### splitting ### leaping ### staggering ### growing } against the windows.
Had he observed a { vision ### picture ### nerve ### hound ### carriage } the night before waiting for me.
Now , there is no one more easy to { exaggerate ### contemplate ### improve ### trace ### guess } than a schoolmaster.
The photograph becomes a { double-edged ### historical ### nicer ### colder ### slow } weapon now.
She was never , as I think I have said , ostentatiously { melancholy ### handsome ### affectionate ### organised ### wounded } , but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly fashion.
There is a { flinty ### mighty ### Methodist ### comfortable ### licensed } sofa.
The man is by trade a conjurer and performer , going round the canteens after nightfall , and giving a little { squeak ### entertainment ### gardening ### shudder ### basket } at each.
You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your { wretched ### lonely ### bachelor ### covetous ### perishing } days then.
I was instantly { aroused ### asleep ### extinguished ### decapitated ### fatigued } , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl.
It is really the most { innocent ### luminous ### handsome ### prudent ### extraordinary } and inexplicable business.
He looked round him with a { greedy ### calm ### furtive ### simple ### sweet } and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit.
He dived his arm down to the bottom of the { chest ### ocean ### mountains ### woodlands ### bluff } , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in.
Thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the { habit ### shape ### minds ### grip ### opinion } of the corpse.
I had been { warned ### kindled ### ravished ### disseminated ### planned } against you months ago.
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three { conspirators ### guards ### keepers ### bedrooms ### manors } opened.
Julia went there at { midnight ### seven ### half-past ### noontime ### Christmas } two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged.
I was just { commencing ### learning ### hearing ### wishing ### balancing } whether I should run for it , or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.
It's about five in the morning , you know , that { libraries ### commands ### sheep ### suicides ### leaves } are most common.
Sherlock Holmes had been { strolling ### hounded ### staring ### beaten ### leaning } back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
Don't you see that the { weather ### misfortune ### picture ### plate ### converse } is equally valid.
We all sat in silence for some little time after { labouring ### dreading ### listening ### struggling ### failing } to this extraordinary narrative.
From one of these I picked a battle-axe , and then , leaving my { candle ### brain ### teeth ### wrists ### fingers } behind me , I crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door.
It would be a { mysterious ### dimpled ### sharp-eyed ### contemptible ### long-legged } coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.
Far away came the sharp { pangs ### edge ### murmur ### clink ### cries } of a boot striking upon a stone.
He had { listened ### spoken ### explained ### complained ### ceased } to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.
All was exactly as I left it , save only that the { hopes ### farms ### feelings ### reptiles ### papers } which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay.
You don't { affirm ### comply ### begin ### stick ### argue } with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.
Running up , I { cast ### attended ### blew ### pursued ### dragged } its brains out , and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.
I had let myself go , and was { revealed ### hailed ### hanging ### joined ### troubled } by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell.
I had not quite understood until that instant how { hairless ### alive ### faithful ### delicate ### wide-awake } my mission was.
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long { looks ### nights ### drive ### battle ### bow } and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.
I rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a { fatality ### battalion ### feather ### spark ### mistake } in the dark hollow of my hand.
I had never seen my friend's face so { clean ### unseen ### cheery ### grim ### ridiculous } or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.
I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman { awakened ### troubled ### seated ### compelled ### obliged } by the table.
But his next { cook ### collar ### convulsion ### remark ### blow } took a weight from my mind.
I clambered out upon the sill , but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who { understands ### loves ### pursued ### regarded ### allowed } me.
I could tell from his expression that he was on a hot { scent ### breakfast ### biscuit ### bath ### seashore } , and yet I could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.
We stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that I failed to catch the most { fleeting ### imperious ### lively ### courteous ### respectful } glance of the front of the house.
A vague feeling of { novelty ### fellowship ### security ### uneasiness ### humanity } began to steal over me.
I have established a right of way through the { success ### contour ### exercise ### obscurity ### centre } of old Middleton's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yards of his own front door.
We are { treated ### fortunate ### fertile ### whirling ### spies } in an enemy's country.
An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the { depth ### style ### vicinity ### midst ### habit } of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.
The other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several { glaciers ### splinters ### joints ### packages ### eunuchs } under his arm.
On the other hand , we brought to the surface an { estimate ### object ### exuberance ### inkling ### excess } of a most unexpected kind.
And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which { trembled ### resided ### ceased ### played ### calls } for such a trial.
Evidently , therefore , Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were { incredible ### damaged ### obdurate ### inquiring ### struggling } when the shot was fired.
Add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a { creature ### mouthful ### hymn ### bite ### policeman } not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail.
I fainted when it was done , and I think that I must have been { preparing ### senseless ### watching ### spoilt ### mistaken } for a long time.
Two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the { extremity ### stroke ### intersection ### value ### correctness } of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
In a { howl ### fit ### law ### period ### pot } of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house , he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.
If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how { generously ### wickedly ### willingly ### patiently ### seriously } you are compromised.
The place we want must be { somewhere ### glowering ### fastened ### moving ### rolling } near that line.
He started me off upon the letter A , and then he left me ; but he would { hide ### occur ### bide ### retreat ### drop } in from time to time to see that all was right with me.
Outside the sun was { sinking ### running ### mysteriously ### prowling ### singing } low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold.
At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was { asking ### hurling ### helping ### hugging ### retaining } me the reasons for my visit.
The shutters cut off the least { ray ### flavor ### perception ### piece ### shade } of light , and we waited in absolute darkness.
Such an { innocence ### earthquake ### owl ### excursion ### artist } could not be kept secret.
That is quite { circled ### touched ### railed ### clenched ### cleared } up now though , indeed , it was obvious from the first.
Within was a small , { haunted ### wicked ### huge ### square ### noble } room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.
The French or the Russian embassy would pay an immense sum to { storm ### increase ### learn ### prosecute ### worship } the contents of these papers.
A few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair { enriched ### dismissed ### rearranged ### touched ### proclaimed } his Southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated Englishman.
Possibly I had taken no { neglect ### degree ### bicycles ### step ### egg } since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported.
Mr. Melas is a { penitent ### policeman ### bystander ### Greek ### prisoner } by extraction , as I understand , and he is a remarkable linguist.
Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of { leaves ### oranges ### medals ### wakefulness ### heliotrope } and a carafe of water.
I noticed her pass , but I had no special reason for { disliking ### watching ### advising ### humouring ### understanding } her.
A few good { dinners ### cases ### knives ### landlords ### taunts } and the reputation which I had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front , and during the last few years I have made him a rich man.
For years I've been dreaming of the bright green { smiles ### orchids ### fields ### cabbages ### twigs } and the hedges of England.
Then he turned down the { Beggar ### lists ### lamp ### estimates ### buns } , and we were left in darkness.
Some chalk { wheels ### cliffs ### scandals ### wagons ### marks } over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which I could see in one of them.
He was plainly but neatly { whitewashed ### dressed ### mended ### soft ### neglected } , and his age , I should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty.
I have no wish to { commit ### carry ### offer ### scold ### grant } you to anything without your having it all laid before you.
He was not remarkable for intelligence , and his answers were frequently { depressed ### motionless ### shaved ### intoxicated ### obscure } , which I attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language.
They undoubtedly showed that the { moon ### sky ### lunch ### affair ### journey } was much deeper than was at first conjectured.
Sherlock Holmes's { luncheon ### ancestry ### bodice ### prophecy ### larder } was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion.
Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the { castle ### passage ### stream ### harp ### lawn } , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction.
Out of this landing opened the { drawing-room ### envelope ### night-gown ### valise ### saddle } and several bedrooms , including those of Mr. Cunningham and his son.
One of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the { smoke ### groans ### outfit ### stream ### murderer } rushed across the garden and over the hedge.
As we passed it Holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately { spurned ### renounced ### knocked ### accepted ### crossed } the whole thing over.
I rang the bell , therefore , to { summon ### surround ### overwhelm ### supplant ### beguile } him.
An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came { ebbing ### staggering ### singing ### pouring ### daintily } out at a side door.
There are many men in London , you know , who , some from { shipboard ### shyness ### carelessness ### reality ### Greenwich } , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows.
The sun had set and { success ### disappointment ### laughter ### dusk ### mischief } was settling over the moor.
He might slip away from us in the { privacy ### shape ### history ### crowd ### claims } of Regent Street , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor.
I expect that within an hour { matters ### kings ### creatures ### volume ### Lucy } will come to a head.
Besides this { incoherent ### collective ### practical ### unspeakable ### preliminary } outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse.
I confess that I felt easier in my mind when , after following Holmes' example and { holding ### sinking ### jostling ### slipping ### prompting } off my shoes , I found myself inside the bedroom.
For all they cared it might have been me , instead of my { thimble ### effigy ### lodging ### childhood ### chest } , which these rascals burned at the stake.
We will be { sold ### charmed ### thrown ### shown ### removed } into the sitting-room to wait for the lady , but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.
I have no doubt at all that a family { farm ### mannerism ### possession ### ghost ### surgeon } can be traced in these two specimens of writing.
They saw that I must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute { security ### reluctance ### indifference ### submission ### failure } to complete despair made them perfectly desperate.
In an instant I was { dotted ### satisfied ### stunned ### delighted ### intoxicated } with a blow and bound hand and foot.
I rushed across the { moors ### yard ### lawn ### chasm ### bedroom } , flung open the window , and looked out.
It was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be { despoiled ### reminded ### uncertain ### forgetful ### suspected } of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay.
The probability was , therefore , that she was { undergoing ### surveying ### selling ### telling ### addressing } the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth.
Then he did the same with the { speed ### rowers ### ceiling ### wood-work ### motion } with which the chamber was panelled.
His clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black { mists ### circumstance ### cloud ### suit ### object } which he usually wore was missing.
To the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to { maintain ### underestimate ### distract ### reconcile ### resign } one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers.
With an apology for my intrusion , I was about to { strike ### swim ### withdraw ### sing ### attack } when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is { conveyed ### entrusted ### reduced ### familiar ### directed } to you.
At two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that I had { sinned ### slept ### supposed ### written ### failed } , and locked the door of the office after me.
it's a { wonderful ### ridiculous ### grown-up ### wicked ### vast } world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.
Five little livid spots , the { defects ### row ### language ### marks ### practice } of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist.
You see , at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your { sanction ### client ### faith ### uncle ### theory } is in close contact with some one who , for good or evil , has an exceptional nature.
I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to { forget ### translate ### smell ### stop ### dislike } it.
If the lady { wore ### studied ### swallowed ### readjusted ### loves } her husband , she does not love your Majesty.
The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , { leaned ### closing ### dismissed ### pushing ### nodding } his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
I thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , { dazzling ### shelterless ### fragrant ### fishy ### irremediable } moor.
He's in { Scotland ### heaven ### smoke ### hiding ### wedlock } , too , but he's not a convict as far as I can make out.
His characteristic talk , with its keen { observance ### instincts ### implements ### expiation ### presumption } of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled.
He found that the { stone ### kiss ### mischief ### stupor ### sadness } which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided.
I was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour , so I { apologized ### shouted ### waited ### swam ### shaved } patiently until he should come round to it.
When he raised his face again , I was { inclined ### unaccustomed ### anxious ### surprised ### accustomed } to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness.
The brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his { colleagues ### blessing ### pocket-book ### council ### wine } , and , ringing the bell , he handed it to the waiter.
I did not know about a projected { entrance ### umbrella ### tombstone ### divorce ### marriage } between herself and her husband.
The shock has made her { uncomfortable ### drive ### half-witted ### scream ### watch } , but I understand that she was never very bright.
I could see at a glance that she was { busy ### spotted ### sick ### equipped ### delighted } with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.
As he turned towards us the { height ### glint ### butt-end ### edge ### depth } of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses.
But I see that the enemy's { preparations ### relations ### bullets ### sorrows ### lands } have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions , which { prevailed ### mingled ### contrasted ### harmonized ### sputtered } with my former experiences.
The butler was standing very { accurately ### gently ### tall ### heartily ### pale } but very collected before us.
The book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so I { stumbled ### trod ### decided ### pushed ### pulled } on my dressing-gown and started off to get it.
When a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her { investigation ### complexion ### ridicule ### society ### instinct } is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
Convinced that some tragedy had { expired ### vanished ### occurred ### disappeared ### departed } , the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it , while scream after scream issued from within.
If you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest { anxiety ### misfortune ### reference ### danger ### service } to you and also to Annie Morrison.
You see that we hold all the cards , and we have only to fear some sudden act of { anxiety ### walking ### violence ### needlework ### charity } on their part.
A vague feeling of { profound ### impending ### perfect ### incurable ### absolute } misfortune impressed me.
I was { ashamed ### tired ### convicted ### proud ### conscious } of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and I fell into the garden below.
It is { singular ### impossible ### inconceivable ### inevitable ### conceivable } that you may even have read some account of the matter.
When a { lamb ### wagon ### soprano ### doctor ### tissue } does go wrong he is the first of criminals.
The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand { upraised ### tonight ### Shortly ### humbly ### Wonderfully } I could feel its hard , rough surface.
The ashes of a fire were { exercised ### expended ### heaped ### rolling ### defeated } in a rude grate.
Your mission today has { exerted ### impressed ### reproached ### squeezed ### justified } itself , and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side.
It is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a { tangled ### civic ### yellow ### luxurious ### stone } hut upon the moor.
There was no { furniture ### bell ### verse ### meat ### escape } save a little pallet bed , a small table , and a basketful of linen.
For answer Holmes { pushed ### crouched ### strode ### sank ### stepped } back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee.
He was unable , however , to make his way in , and the { bellows ### angels ### stars ### maids ### kites } were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.
There was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some { encouragement ### warmth ### speaking ### whistle ### hardness } , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty.
I heard a gentle sound of { sisters ### disgrace ### hammers ### blows ### movement } , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger.
But sometimes a letter may be { enjoyed ### divided ### confident ### legible ### disentangled } even when burned.
And that was how a great scandal threatened to { stampede ### mitigate ### enjoy ### affect ### chastise } the kingdom of Bohemia , and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.
At the time the circumstances made a deep { shadow ### impression ### gash ### crevice ### sneer } upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
He was a solicitor and was { serving ### using ### composing ### addressing ### surveying } my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.
As a rule , when I have heard some { jeweled ### slight ### wailing ### fashionable ### luminous } indication of the course of events , I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.
His brain is as { unreal ### pale ### cunning ### loud ### bald } as his fingers , and though we meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself.
We could see the { lights ### orchards ### marks ### drops ### Negroes } in the wood where it had been pushed in.
A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated { hymn ### opening ### moss ### pouch ### corks } which served as a door.
The freckles started out on the { slightest ### lady's ### Federal ### mountain ### outer } face.
Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant , ' said he , and { gathered ### vanished ### peering ### crackled ### cast } into the darkness.
An important { incident ### revolution ### complication ### incongruity ### addition } has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.
You have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his { sanctuary ### conscience ### host ### editorial ### wickedness } bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed.
I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite { gentle ### secure ### rational ### empty ### correct } , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'Hullo' I yelled 'Hullo.
Two hansoms were standing at the door , and as I entered the { processes ### passage ### accident ### spring ### ball } I heard the sound of voices from above.
It was a little past six when I { chose ### reflected ### arrived ### frolicked ### explained } , so I went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.
He was very willing to have a holiday , so we { spent ### shut ### loaded ### changed ### straddled } the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
They have given up the { chase ### creek ### pavements ### chimney ### aisle } there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him.
The King may do what he will without { passing ### hurrying ### hindrance ### flinching ### moving } from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
The door at the bottom was { closed ### destroyed ### iron ### insidious ### empty } , but unlocked.
I found him much { disappointment ### reading ### troubled ### dining ### delight } over the disappearance of his little spaniel.
We live very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and we keep a { candle ### mirror ### necklace ### roof ### cloud } over our heads and pay our debts , if we do nothing more.
But the evening has brought a { fault ### ticket ### newspaper ### dynamo ### breeze } with it.
Were it not for the { stricken ### marvellous ### ugly ### growing ### attractive } wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
Surely the explanation of all this could not be as { innocent ### yellow ### loud ### tough ### eloquent } as she would have me believe.
I was a happy and successful man , Mr. Holmes , and on the eve of being married , when a sudden and dreadful misfortune { compelled ### caused ### melted ### wrecked ### humoured } all my prospects in life.
They had each been stabbed , it seems , and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had { recovered ### quarreled ### eaten ### disarmed ### joked } and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other.
My wife had already gone upstairs , and the sound of the { discovery ### irony ### locking ### illusion ### teaching } of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired.
I am an { acre ### interpreter ### indemnity ### undertone ### improvisation } , as perhaps my neighbor there has told you.
Let me pass , I say' He { dashed ### appraised ### gathered ### bade ### begged } her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon.
Holmes's voice { stared ### sank ### hummed ### limped ### shot } as he answered.
It is a little place near the { memory ### smell ### balance ### dexterity ### borders } of Oxfordshire , and within seven miles of Reading.
He'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his { food ### trial ### service ### pyjamas ### tracks } for years and was a good servant.
I am a light sleeper , and it has { treated ### commanded ### deserted ### awakened ### puzzled } me.
It is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to { fetch ### inform ### offer ### disturb ### bury } you.
He was deadly pale and terribly { impromptu ### emaciated ### prudish ### headless ### profane } , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength.
The house was just such as I had { replaced ### touched ### unlocked ### denied ### pictured } it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.
I sprang from my bed , { using ### hitching ### wrapped ### unbuttoning ### sported } a shawl round me , and rushed into the corridor.
The law is upon his side , and every day I am { amused ### faced ### enchanted ### studied ### honored } by the possibility that he may force me to live with him.
I have seen it on him , and could { migrate ### contribute ### swear ### write ### climb } to it.
There were two guides given us to { argue ### quarrel ### start ### dine ### lodge } with , an oak and an elm.
The thieves { ruled ### ransacked ### identified ### enjoyed ### visited } the library and got very little for their pains.
If my hair would only change { yours ### clothing ### colour ### sides ### names } , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.
It was a quiet , little , plainly { distinguished ### furnished ### fuming ### scorched ### timid } room , with a round table in the centre , on which several German books were scattered.
He had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our { fraud ### appetites ### guests ### aid ### enemies } had come too late.
Holmes drew one of the { chairs ### boats ### spies ### features ### savages } into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment.
It is { plain ### likely ### conjectured ### inconceivable ### probable } that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it.
Then once more the footsteps approached and a { shadow ### glance ### gust ### blow ### bullet } fell across the opening of the hut.
I took off the { dresses ### ribbon ### saddles ### kettle ### roof } and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor.
There , sitting together in the { pavement ### reins ### newspapers ### twilight ### seasons } , I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady.
But not one word shall they have from me , and I { join ### promise ### miss ### taught ### bind } you to secrecy also , Dr. Watson.
We even { imagined ### disabled ### traced ### judged ### preceded } them as far as Reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands.
Pray interrupt me if there is any { aperture ### imprudence ### inference ### proficiency ### evil } which is not perfectly clear to you.
It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny , and has since that time { prepared ### anticipated ### associated ### stated ### distinguished } itself upon every possible occasion.
In an instant the three of us had torn them away from him , and Holmes staggered to his feet , very { brisk ### interested ### smooth ### stately ### pale } and evidently greatly exhausted.
She writhed as one who is in terrible { pain ### danger ### consequences ### earnestness ### remorse } , and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.
There could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the { undoubted ### salutary ### singular ### genuine ### secretive } disappearance of the door-key.
No one could pass these { subjects ### shutters ### flowers ### objects ### letters } if they were bolted.
I had no { pretensions ### impulse ### objection ### opportunity ### inclination } to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before , for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late.
And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and { cook ### forget ### visit ### reveal ### renew } his interest.
A coachman and two { maids ### animals ### policemen ### ravens ### planes } form the staff of servants.
I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine' He took a step backward , cocked his head on one side , and { shivered ### hurried ### gazed ### jumped ### glanced } at my hair until I felt quite bashful.
The more formal we made the { nations ### move ### mistake ### visit ### mirror } the less information we might obtain.
We hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the { mirror ### address ### candle ### rainbow ### mantle } which had been given to us.
It was evident that a { chisel ### lord ### frigate ### nurse ### barrel } or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it.
Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with an { dissimulation ### ambiguity ### intentness ### emphasis ### alacrity } which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused.
Ferguson appeared to be a { captive ### useful ### prince ### novel ### morose } and silent man , but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.
What is the { meaning ### symbol ### luxury ### proportion ### fury } of it all.
The letter had , as I said , been { burned ### idle ### born ### disturbed ### closed } and it was not all legible.
Palmer and Pritchard were among the { heads ### nations ### penalties ### events ### results } of their profession.
It is to { recompense ### befall ### allow ### convince ### restore } you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession.
It had wandered on to the { dirt ### couch ### moor ### hotel ### ledge } and had never come back.
I could only move it slightly , and it was with the { aid ### intention ### exception ### remains ### fury } of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying it to one side.
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in { advance ### bulk ### excuse ### quest ### spite } of.
A ventilator is made , a { suspicion ### cord ### card ### choice ### battle } is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.
You say yourself that the horse was fresh and { beaten ### glossy ### sickening ### disconsolate ### naked } when you got in.
I tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter { freely ### darker ### aside ### aboard ### indispensable } until night should bring an explanation.
Suddenly , amid all the { lassitude ### thunders ### risk ### glow ### hubbub } of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.
If you leave , you { forfeit ### spent ### drown ### haven't ### murder } your whole position forever.
However , I { hated ### imagine ### healed ### forgot ### threw } all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to Paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
Even without the lens you will { escape ### prosper ### repent ### perceive ### exclaim } , by the scratches on this ward , where the pressure was applied.
It cost me something in foolscap , and I had pretty nearly filled a { tumbler ### jug ### level ### ticket ### shelf } with my writings.
Round one of his hands he had a { handkerchief ### tail ### weapon ### gondolier ### gun } wrapped , which was mottled all over with bloodstains.
Holmes dashed into the crowd to { protect ### conquer ### replace ### misunderstand ### abandon } the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face.
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly { stepped ### whisked ### dragged ### staggered ### dashed } open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.
In an instant it was { persuaded ### desirable ### impossible ### conjectured ### obvious } that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently.
A Greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an { interpreter ### advocate ### explorer ### orchestra ### archdeacon } were indispensable.
Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still { walking ### burning ### sleeping ### snowing ### growling } soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start.
My attention was speedily { retired ### drawn ### mollified ### exterminated ### exhausted } , as I have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.
I keep it only to { humiliate ### compromise ### hide ### possess ### safeguard } myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future.
I dressed hurriedly , for I knew by experience that railway { trains ### passengers ### carriages ### trials ### cases } were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs.
He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a { mile ### lift ### movement ### glance ### visit } homeward.
Right in front of the house , upon the left-hand side of the drive , there stood a patriarch among { matrons ### engineers ### oaks ### madmen ### goddesses } , one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.
His chin was { climbed ### sheathed ### plunged ### cocked ### running } upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.
Then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a { crushing ### cardboard ### modest ### viscous ### harmonious } weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul.
It looked as if the pair might take an { envied ### economical ### experienced ### immediate ### unfamiliar } departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.
The bell-rope hangs from the { scene ### clouds ### valley ### hill ### wire } just to the right of my desk.
He broke the seal and { threw ### leaped ### burst ### glanced ### waved } over the contents.
Whatever she may have deserved one could not { allow ### follow ### restrain ### pity ### escape } her to go hopelessly to the bad.
Before entering , Holmes made an { estimate ### examination ### interchange ### exhibition ### access } of the door which had been forced.
Suddenly , however , as I ran , a { tranquil ### sturdy ### curious ### vehement ### deadly } dizziness and sickness came over me.
As to the photograph , your { opinion ### deception ### application ### client ### charity } may rest in peace.
Look at this { train ### apparition ### stranger ### temporary ### frantic } hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting.
The lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was { addressed ### intolerable ### disinclined ### removed ### disposed } to her room , still in a state of insensibility.
It must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was { pale ### jolting ### scant ### breaking ### furious } when I came to myself.
What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to { luxuriate ### wiggle ### dine ### lurk ### grow } in such a place at such a time.
If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving { blanks ### books ### sacks ### food ### arsenic } for the other to fill up.
He sat at my side in silence all the time , and I was aware , more than once when I { glanced ### paused ### engaged ### detected ### awoke } in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity.
Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a { truce ### battle ### wedding ### consultation ### meal } was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room.
A maid { dwelt ### talked ### rushed ### slept ### fainted } across and threw open the window.
At Waterloo we were fortunate in { grasping ### accepting ### discussing ### choosing ### catching } a train for Leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes.
When I went upstairs with him he pointed to several { voyages ### footprints ### truths ### trenches ### accidents } upon the light carpet.
Here we { dismissed ### grasped ### cudgeled ### nursed ### penetrated } our cab , and made our way up the drive together.
Then suddenly he plunged forward , { scraped ### wrung ### remembering ### ate ### poked } my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success.
But here an unexpected and singular { proposal ### history ### difficulty ### applicant ### sauce } presented itself.
Both cases { asleep ### decided ### outdoors ### rapt ### sentimental } , Dr. Watson , and both in my favour.
Besides , remember that she had { knelt ### spoken ### resolved ### shifted ### written } to use it within a few days.
I am sure that if you { killed ### disobey ### preferred ### mentioned ### admire } my name they would be happy to show it to you.
Suddenly , however , he started , { tapped ### watching ### motioning ### prompted ### leading } me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows.
She then called for Miss Morrison , a young lady who lives in the next { verse ### villa ### century ### generation ### month } , and the two went off together to their meeting.
We are at present , Doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the City branch of one of the { painful ### Athenian ### principal ### holy ### unsettled } London banks.
There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was { hanged ### paid ### longing ### searching ### famous } for it.
Yet , with all this , you made me { reveal ### sustain ### thank ### persuade ### to-day } what you wanted to know.
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house , with Toller { browsing ### heaped ### hurrying ### clapping ### clinging } behind us.
I heard that Barclay had married Nancy , and that he was { rising ### painting ### strolling ### dining ### playing } rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak.
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any { result ### reply ### praise ### hindrance ### danger } from within.
The King { rejoiced ### knocked ### stared ### smiled ### landed } at him in amazement.
I handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and { smoked ### screamed ### danced ### raged ### shouted } for some time in silence.
He carries some { doubts ### poetry ### falsehoods ### information ### creature } about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it.
I could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark { forehead ### skin ### eyebrows ### dress ### dishes } I knew that it was a rich material.
He had started { wallowing ### blowing ### running ### streaming ### bowing } swiftly over the moor , and I had followed at his heels.
The new { miracles ### volume ### current ### century ### illustration } will have come , however , before the story can be safely told.
I determined to wait until I got back to town before { leaving ### hoisting ### attacking ### holding ### telling } my story to the police.
His face set hard , and a baleful light { tiptoed ### wrapped ### sprang ### smiled ### pursed } up in his grey eyes.
As it is , I feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my { forefoot ### comforter ### wrist ### cap ### musket } round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand.
If the former , she had probably { traversed ### deplored ### assumed ### adorned ### transferred } the photograph to his keeping.
The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between { secrets ### buildings ### layers ### facts ### roses } of lead foil.
I had { studied ### waited ### stooped ### breakfasted ### sprouted } and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
Her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to { decline ### offer ### express ### perform ### earn } an honest living.
He had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a { costume ### tenderness ### sensation ### suggestion ### kick } which one would hardly have expected from his appearance.
He was { alleviated ### oppressed ### haunted ### enforced ### accompanied } by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.
My stepfather has { withheld ### offered ### spared ### earned ### retained } no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring.
It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have { hurt ### stumped ### aroused ### bought ### killed } your curiosity.
I knew that it was my { unreasonable ### mightier ### sister's ### weak ### gambling } voice.
In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the { nearest ### tall ### polished ### sodden ### important } moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.
The proceedings against the page broke down for want of { evidence ### discretion ### inquest ### suspicions ### refuse } , and the Brook Street Mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print.
It was nearly { determined ### midway ### accumulated ### mentioned ### harmony } between the oak and the house.
If you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for God's sake let me give you notice and leave in a { month ### semicircle ### drawer ### trance ### cart } , as if of my own free will.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other { idler ### emperor ### barber ### aunt ### minister } who has dropped into a church.
I am only , of course , giving you the leading { complaints ### results ### officers ### spirits ### voices } now of my examination of the paper.
Therefore something had occurred between { heaven ### Bombay ### fifty ### seven-thirty ### nine } and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.
If I could get his { meal ### interval ### dignity ### patience ### knowledge } it might save me a long and weary hunt.
I could only check it by { declaring ### refusing ### promising ### yielding ### finding } if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not { cancel ### throw ### earn ### contain ### involve } some further light upon these dark places.
It will give him the { grounds ### clue ### cook ### school ### concern } for which he has been seeking.
He has { sneered ### yelled ### hysterics ### shuddered ### nerve } and he has knowledge.
Then , when I { flash ### wrote ### proposed ### recall ### smoke } a light upon them , close in swiftly.
But we have more { wearisome ### assured ### moral ### liberal ### Pagan } reasons than that for supposing it.
He was once a { peg ### crack ### queen ### panel ### schoolmaster } in the north of England.
She listened for an instant , { packed ### climbed ### piled ### threw ### pricked } up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
His dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of { superiority ### curiosity ### information ### color ### sadness } about his necktie.
The lady looked quickly up with an { loose ### ample ### owlish ### occasional ### angry } gleam in her hazel eyes.
We are but { humiliating ### preventing ### crying ### running ### packing } her from injuring another.
There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was { patched ### showing ### washed ### caked ### peeling } off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches.
It might or might not { bite ### pity ### produce ### disdain ### alter } the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
I measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and I { formed ### spent ### excited ### beheld ### thrust } a peg into the spot.
Neither address nor { population ### smell ### date ### honesty ### taste } is attached to it.
The twilight had { swelled ### strayed ### perished ### reined ### closed } in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.
But the girl held true to me , and it seemed that I would have had her when the { clouds ### moon ### storm ### ape-man ### Mutiny } broke out , and all hell was loose in the country.
He was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the { precision ### exception ### epithets ### delight ### intensity } of his emotion.
There was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man { motioned ### contended ### discovered ### provided ### performed } that I should sit in it.
It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the { meek ### crafty ### canvas ### frowning ### leaking } cylinder.
Until after the { glories ### labours ### sweetness ### meaning ### alarm } of fire , I had not a suspicion.
He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing { rings ### privacy ### traditions ### answers ### stiffness } and averted eyes.
The house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty { leagues ### yards ### slaves ### weeks ### pence } from the high-road.
You are to ask the questions , Mr. Melas , and he will { write ### destroy ### wash ### arouse ### spoil } the answers.
At one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the { posterity ### departure ### lid ### existence ### recollection } of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock.
He turned the two best { feelings ### interests ### pictures ### rooms ### fragments } of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself.
It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall , at the { rooms ### bottom ### edge ### shades ### facade } of Mr. Melas.
A young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich { scent ### plains ### soil ### ornaments ### spoils } of the garden and the balmy summer air.
As I ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and { bent ### paced ### beamed ### stared ### revolved } slowly upon its hinges.
One side of the window was open , which I understand was quite usual in the { summer-time ### yard ### moonlight ### woods ### staircase } , and he passed without difficulty into the room.
It was an old { tartan ### iron ### convent ### rickety ### gray } door and gave at once before our united strength.
And yet it would be the { bride's ### blackest ### innocent ### chivalrous ### academic } treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
He is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their { surfaces ### thumping ### personality ### experience ### infancy } the other night.
You have all the cleverness which makes a { plain ### successful ### lean ### courteous ### tired } man.
His secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to { forget ### dispel ### enable ### exercise ### divulge } it.
Nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to { suggest ### prove ### acknowledge ### hint ### predict } that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.
And into her { hut ### list ### lap ### pocket ### sitting-room } , which was the very room which I suspected.
And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter , the { practice ### explanation ### liberality ### application ### possibility } of which is still involved in some mystery.
I suppose there would be no chance of a { tunnel ### pace ### horse's ### train ### brook } back.
His heart was { unpalatable ### spectacular ### charming ### unfair ### weak } , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision.
But now your thoughts went back to Beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were { hugging ### ascending ### boarding ### dismissing ### studying } the character in his features.
But incredulity and indifference were evidently my { drinking ### scientific ### largest ### strongest ### unwary } cards.
And then again , sir , we were both of us very { wide ### impatient ### ill ### fond ### apprehensive } of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us.
As it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a { morose ### shrewd ### brave ### surprising ### nobler } and disappointed man.
He was off in one of those { useful ### admirable ### hysterical ### ambitious ### vague } outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
I made no allusion to what had passed , and { tied ### encircled ### kicked ### waited ### watered } with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.
Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room , and was { allowed ### constrained ### promoted ### relieved ### attached } to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.
These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as { valuable ### commonplace ### loud ### delightful ### quick } as a gold-mine.
Then Mr. Alec ran out and { clattered ### peered ### skipped ### wandered ### knelt } beside the wounded man.
It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was { ejected ### consumed ### awakened ### startled ### softened } by the butler and the footman.
While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer , who had acquired an { ascendancy ### opprobrium ### aurora ### animosity ### existence } over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him.
I ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her { arguments ### health ### nerve ### knees ### cheeks } seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
For a moment or two I sat { today ### breathless ### reading ### dreaming ### professionally } , hardly able to believe my ears.
He is a bit of a Don Juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very { limber ### ingenious ### tender ### formal ### difficult } part to play in a quiet country district.
I will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these { sounds ### papers ### dinners ### sights ### kites } and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
He was a man of singular habits , { discovering ### shunning ### providing ### biting ### keeping } company and very seldom going out.
As I gave a last { greedy ### contemptuous ### merry ### hurried ### adoring } glance around , I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.
He appeared to be { honest ### gay ### cheery ### asleep ### deformed } , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent.
The woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the { reckless ### cushioned ### fiercest ### yellow ### hanging } light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.
Luck had been against us again and again in this { inquiry ### hall ### century ### coach ### mood } , but now at last it came to my aid.
I rose and examined carefully the different { points ### stages ### symptoms ### billets ### degrees } of wood which were scattered round the floor.
And yet I { suppressed ### devoured ### sold ### remembered ### learned } all appearance of interest.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be { built ### travelling ### sprinkled ### walking ### drifting } across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission.
It hadn't pulled up before she { stammered ### wrote ### threw ### faltered ### shot } out of the hall door and into it.
In an instant his strange { tongues ### headgear ### agony ### warmth ### noises } began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
As we walked home together , Holmes stopped at a { rickety ### telegraph ### dreary ### milliner's ### village } office and sent off several wires.
A splendid { park ### canoe ### rocker ### devil ### cigar } with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building.
It was not until we had reached home that I began to { haunt ### ravage ### outrun ### realize ### undermine } the true state of affairs.
For that matter , { Reading ### individuals ### weapons ### maidens ### gentlemen } , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all.
He was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an { allusion ### opportunity ### insult ### attempt ### offering } to cover extreme natural diffidence.
I often take advantage of the { jurymen ### mountain ### trail ### freedom ### rock } which it gives.
It was a delicate point , and it { fetched ### guarded ### embraced ### whispered ### widened } the field of my inquiry.
He has been very { difficult ### attentive ### impatient ### inaccessible ### anxious } to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on.
It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London , and the { labourers ### rivers ### fittings ### singers ### paving-stones } , though frayed , were of rich quality.
No case , however , in which Holmes was engaged has ever { overlooked ### apportioned ### examined ### facilitated ### illustrated } the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.
But then , when I found how I had { reared ### ordered ### studied ### betrayed ### ripened } myself , I began to think.
I am a { brave ### dangerous ### scientific ### weak ### dying } man to fall foul of.
It was worth an effort to find out , and for that { event ### repast ### ridge ### circumstance ### object } we all went up to the house.
Then suddenly another sound became { audible ### dislodged ### unmanageable ### fixed ### smothered } a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.
No sound came from within , and at the silence Holmes' face { soared ### clouded ### flamed ### bent ### twitched } over.
The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the { sky ### lamp ### incident ### handmaiden ### watchman } was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
It gave even my { familiar ### hardened ### deluded ### long-standing ### disagreeable } nerves a shudder to look at it.
At first he was very { inadequate ### rude ### foolish ### injurious ### eager } to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better.
You may then walk to the end of the street , and I will { teach ### marry ### lend ### rejoin ### kill } you in ten minutes.
It was a { serious ### sweet ### delightful ### pleasant ### wise } thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody.
For many years I have been the chief Greek { counter ### interpreter ### valise ### snow-flake ### colony } in London , and my name is very well known in the hotels.
I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong { image ### sign ### routine ### odor ### habits } of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.
I trust that I am not more { dense ### powerful ### contemptible ### impatient ### melancholy } than my neighbours , but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.
He had { scarcely ### ordinarily ### unintentionally ### overwhelmingly ### evidently } been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.
The inspector had { lit ### sold ### bent ### removed ### destroyed } his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them.
The cries , which had { lain ### swept ### sunk ### blown ### rolled } down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited.
I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to { relieve ### consult ### South ### shorten ### sell } America.
I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the { corridor ### highways ### ceiling ### valleys ### walks } and down a winding stair.
You , of course , saw that { disaster ### mechanism ### everyone ### scene ### apparition } in the street was an accomplice.
She left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , { playing ### staring ### chatting ### gazing ### understanding } about her approaching wedding.
For God's sake , sir , I { mention ### admit ### grant ### beg ### consider } of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy { pearl ### trap ### stick ### sob ### newspaper } in his hand.
Nor was the fact of the { deceased ### box ### carriage ### snow ### wound } being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow.
God help those who wander into the great { cheer ### pulpit ### ocean ### stair ### mire } now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass.
Suddenly there was the { scaly ### easiest ### female ### literal ### momentary } gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
The Lord St. Simon marriage , and its { magnetic ### pompous ### curious ### eternal ### safer } termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.
We both sat in silence for some little time after { conviction ### listening ### clinging ### learning ### preaching } to this extraordinary narrative.
When I had made it clear to them , I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to { search ### preserve ### satisfy ### rescue ### spoil } my own curiosity.
I made excellent { appetites ### wine ### coffee ### spirits ### arrangements } , and they are only delayed one day upon their way.
But there were { underground ### written ### famous ### ample ### eighty } signs that I had not come upon a false scent.
The furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly { taught ### assigned ### ransacked ### warned ### rebuked } them before her flight.
I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and { feeding ### clad ### bathed ### swarming ### grouped } in some sort of loose white gown.
Peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which { flickered ### disappeared ### descended ### trickled ### dangled } from a small brass tripod in the centre.
She had been terribly { required ### honoured ### renewed ### arrested ### excited } immediately after his disappearance.
If I lay on my face the { problem ### enemy ### weight ### future ### attempt } would come upon my spine , and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.
The garden and the stables of course have a { ringed ### separate ### steel ### tin ### cast-iron } staff.
Sorry to see that you've had the British { workman ### Museum ### abode ### Empire ### island } in the house.
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was { complete ### warm ### intense ### issued ### extinguished } , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.
The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit { bristled ### flourished ### slipped ### rolled ### swallowed } about into every corner of the room.
My companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the { inquest ### porch ### wharf ### weapon ### cradle } , I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.
I shall call with the King { yesterday ### summer ### gift ### to-morrow ### rarity } , and with you , if you care to come with us.
I took out my { nose ### revolver ### interests ### finger ### wishes } and laid it on the corner of the table.
The air had turned { colourless ### pale ### chill ### soft ### hot } and we withdrew into the hut for warmth.
I should like , however , to understand a little more { willingly ### clearly ### comfortably ### seriously ### successfully } what it is that you wish me to do.
The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was { due ### yielded ### forced ### delighted ### disposed } to apoplexy.
But he will never trouble { service ### refuges ### drawings ### essays ### anyone } in this country again.
I should not wish a smarter { prophet ### window-sill ### foe ### duke ### assistant } , Mr. Holmes ; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.
I have no reason to be { expected ### spoken ### discovered ### ashamed ### capable } of it.
A low moaning sound was coming from { influences ### persecution ### significantly ### somewhere ### ranches } over our heads.
Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again I marked my { spot ### chances ### marriage ### acquaintance ### grave } with a peg.
I came in by train this morning , and on { inquiring ### exhibition ### deck ### arriving ### duty } at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.
Besides , we must be { prompt ### wonderful ### convicted ### described ### hungry } , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the { province ### size ### generosity ### tendency ### medium } of a sheet of note-paper.
His life was { irregular ### empty ### bewitched ### ended ### unavoidable } , but in one respect he was regularity itself.
She married an artist named Lyons , who came { floating ### crawling ### sketching ### leaping ### bouncing } on the moor.
The Colonel possessed a varied collection of { urchins ### wine ### letters ### lights ### weapons } brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies.
You can hardly realize , then , how { difficult ### promptly ### thankful ### slow-witted ### hungry } I found it at first , and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.
The flush had { strutted ### swarmed ### crept ### awakened ### faded } in an instant , and a deathly face was before me.
At last she looked up with something { pallid ### warm ### jovial ### reckless ### solid } and defiant in her manner.
It had been { hacked ### insulted ### stifled ### banished ### seduced } or torn right out from the roots.
I could , however , see that his face was { beautifully ### purple ### positively ### glossy ### deadly } pale and filled with horror and loathing.
His broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his { horrified ### nerveless ### cunning ### claw-like ### sympathetic } smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
It was the same good friend whose warning I had so { strangely ### nobly ### foolishly ### lingeringly ### accurately } rejected.
I have only one other incident to record upon this { obedient ### tempestuous ### quaint ### excellent ### smirking } and melancholy day.
Each daughter can claim an { enemy ### apron ### opinion ### income ### intermission } of 250 pounds , in case of marriage.
The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed { heavily ### quietly ### shakily ### somewhere ### incessantly } behind us , and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
Of course he must { witness ### lead ### recall ### cross ### obey } the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.
On the table stood a { pony ### log ### dish ### dark-lantern ### rope } with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar.
The photograph is in a { recess ### field ### fog ### string ### swamp } behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.
He laughed very heartily , with a high , { ringing ### tender ### eerie ### faint ### simpering } note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.
The carpet prevents any { recollection ### remembrance ### explanation ### deficiency ### possibility } of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind.
Evidently because he saw something in it which had { dissipated ### forgotten ### escaped ### crushed ### overpowered } all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage.
He unwound the { gun ### handkerchief ### plant ### saddle ### frock } and held out his hand.
Altogether there are eight maids , the { dog-cart ### cook ### velocity ### mast ### lake } , the butler , two footmen , and a boy.
I simply want your { anxiety ### resolution ### enchantment ### intentions ### opinion } about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear.
I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a { deer ### curry ### surgeon ### cypher ### burr } , go where he might.
We were at breakfast when the Colonel's { mattresses ### train ### butler ### beard ### kitten } rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.
He had trained it , probably by the use of the { guilt ### milk ### shrubs ### sarcasm ### emotions } which we saw , to return to him when summoned.
I rushed { forever ### correctly ### madly ### laudably ### gently } from the room on to the landing.
I have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and I think I'll { debar ### count ### sink ### overhaul ### capture } them in you.
If there was one { report ### trip ### reef ### liberal ### misfortune } there might be others , so I looked round the hut in search of them.
His eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he { leaned ### dropped ### rode ### staggered ### frolicked } on his face upon the ground.
Half a { pinch ### guinea ### trade ### farthing ### mile } if you do it in twenty minutes.
It's not a very large { arm-chair ### tempo ### picture ### affair ### stick } , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.
She knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the { chariot ### saddle ### lamp ### wheel ### handle } , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.
All my { yearning ### medical ### future ### sister's ### chosen } instincts rose up against that laugh.
At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she { glanced ### reappeared ### grovelled ### paused ### rushed } at the door and looked back.
So tall was he that his hat { profoundly ### proudly ### urgently ### actually ### satisfactorily } brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.
These were all { dogs ### toys ### creatures ### factors ### throbbings } which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter.
I implored the { attachment ### design ### route ### colonel ### action } to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.
I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to { await ### imitate ### reach ### remove ### regulate } the heart of the mystery.
This must be the { dishes ### conversation ### difference ### orchestra ### burrow } where the stranger lurked.
My friend hardly glanced up as I entered , and I , seeing that his { fame ### investigation ### servants ### vanity ### journeys } must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited.
Would she not have made an { oval ### imaginary ### enormous ### admirable ### amateur } queen.
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the { music ### store-room ### shadows ### stream ### doorway } at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
In normal cases one can place a man in his true { biography ### operations ### decade ### displacement ### contention } with tolerable confidence.
Then I , rather imprudently , wished you { wise ### good-night ### harvest ### arrived ### to-morrow } , and started for the Temple to see my husband.
I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my { helplessness ### solitude ### tongue ### pipe ### fork } when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.
These walls are { sanded ### narrow ### thick ### thin ### rough } , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard.
One other detail of interest was { emulated ### assisted ### aggravated ### repelled ### remembered } by Jane Stewart , the housemaid.
In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket , and { dropped ### wrung ### kissed ### dipped ### repeated } my stick while I was chasing Teddy , who had run up the curtain.
Together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united { inquiry ### force ### vices ### liaison ### evidence } would suffice to raise the stone.
Everything was { disappointed ### born ### buried ### working ### lodged } in my favour , and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.
Throwing aside my { opinion ### luncheon-table ### cigarette ### manager ### sister-in-law } , I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , I looked in.
Once or twice we drifted into talk , and I can remember that more than once he { owned ### noticed ### wore ### expressed ### underwent } a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.
For myself , my term of service in India had { imprisoned ### arrested ### trained ### thrilled ### invited } me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship.
It is not a common { note ### denomination ### experience ### thief ### law } among employers in this age.
But a singular { diligence ### anecdote ### fortune ### interruption ### fascination } brought us to a standstill.
There he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little { cloud ### shadow ### cottage ### bundle ### crowd } upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill.
I think that there was { particularly ### barely ### scarcely ### evidently ### probably } some more tangible cause.
Holmes had { glared ### wasted ### slanted ### muttered ### slipped } away , but he came back in a few minutes.
Again and again I { understood ### finished ### deemed ### liked ### cross-questioned } her , but I could never get past that point.
Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is { watered ### separated ### represented ### caused ### supported } by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road.
All you have to do is just to { shut ### blow ### pick ### wear ### sweep } out your chair in the consulting-room.
As he { sailed ### emerged ### dangled ### collected ### issued } from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance.
That is his { successful ### mother's ### main ### generous ### favourite } fault , but on the whole he's a good worker.
He was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable { culture ### courage ### violence ### tact ### discretion } and vindictiveness.
I fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and { sheathed ### taught ### measured ### subdued ### invested } it.
It is a perfectly overpowering { airship ### unkindness ### admonition ### impulse ### misdemeanour } , and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed , and Mr. Alec was { wearing ### humming ### merely ### smoking ### addressing } a pipe in his dressing-gown.
It is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a { moderate ### mere ### marvellous ### higher ### finer } pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
You must not { obtain ### gather ### interfere ### omit ### signify } , come what may.
Your task is { welcome ### refreshing ### born ### confined ### offered } to that.
Some three hours or so { surely ### wildly ### morally ### evidently ### afterwards } we were all in the train together , bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
Your interview with the lady has cleared the { situation ### fence ### food ### instrument ### building } very much.
The portly client puffed out his { leg ### cage ### chest ### note-book ### ankle } with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
It could only be a small one , or it would have been { dashed ### remarked ### aroused ### climbed ### preached } upon at the coroner's inquiry.
She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to { beguile ### remove ### improve ### bungle ### approach } the last trace of her crime.
The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we { ate ### lurched ### landed ### collected ### marooned } and jolted terribly.
It struck cold to our hearts , and I stood { languidly ### defiantly ### grinning ### smiling ### gazing } at Holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
Even my { resolution ### design ### dread ### enjoyment ### hopes } of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
The light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the { hillside ### pamphlet ### railroad ### darkness ### sunshine } came a reedy , quivering voice.
As to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to { eat ### support ### mention ### buy ### defray } whatever expenses I may be put to , at the time which suits you best.
That frightful cry turned the blood to { succeed ### ice ### reside ### remain ### appear } in my veins.
I have told you now the whole truth , and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not { realize ### cease ### rejoice ### repent ### confess } then the danger in which my dear friend stood.
I paid the man and { delivered ### withered ### hurried ### rode ### reduced } into the church.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes { shining ### wandering ### kindling ### knocking ### growing } brightly between puckered lids.
And , first of all , we must { disgrace ### choose ### destroy ### aggravate ### familiarize } our positions.
All my unspoken instincts , my { heated ### blind ### comic ### vague ### warmest } suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist.
We shall just be in time to have a little { garment ### breakfast ### elegance ### basket ### dog } with him.
Besides , I knew that my { mistress ### assistant ### estate ### fate ### grandmother } was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up.
I have a { copy ### map ### meeting ### box ### plantation } of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them.
During my long and { unalterable ### inexorable ### agreeable ### intimate ### destructive } acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life.
I act { entirely ### apart ### loose ### differently ### safe } from a sense of public duty.
She stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly { watching ### asking ### serving ### escorting ### recognizing } me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.
His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was { falling ### drawn ### interrogated ### drooped ### lying } quite tense over his outstanding bones.
I've never { earned ### spent ### drank ### breathed ### missed } a word about it yet to mortal man.
That cold , { self-contained ### incisive ### serene ### inflexible ### hungry } , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.
My heart is { punished ### falling ### distressed ### soaring ### lightened } already since I have confided my trouble to you.
And your { repentance ### godmother ### address ### worship ### ugliness } had been given me.
My clothes were all { packed ### charged ### supplied ### tattered ### sodden } with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
The walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the { ascent ### wood ### engagement ### flooring ### incubator } was also thoroughly examined , with the same result.
His aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his { frightful ### charming ### princely ### graceful ### unemotional } character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people.
He was all right , as far as money went , but in his { deposit ### lifetime ### pocket ### temperament ### throat } he had given her what looked like a bad florin.
The Duke , his father , was at one time { Secretary ### fitted ### confused ### entertained ### bought } for Foreign Affairs.
If she were ill-used , then at any risks I was { permitted ### destined ### unable ### invited ### determined } to go back to her assistance.
My poor friend's face had suddenly { remembered ### gripped ### relinquished ### assumed ### grasped } the most dreadful expression.
More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so { interested ### terrible ### eager ### absorbed ### narrow } was the effect.
These are { blind ### daring ### simply ### ten-pound ### temperate } men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
All day today the { cauldron ### garments ### coins ### rain ### acorns } poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves.
You will observe that the hour { closed ### resounded ### trampled ### swarmed ### mentioned } upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate.
He proved to be a blackguard and { pressed ### deserted ### closed ### pushed ### saluted } her.
My companion let down the window , and I caught a glimpse of a low , { marshy ### arched ### winding ### unpaved ### placid } doorway with a lamp burning above it.
He will not even go out of his way to { embrace ### verify ### overcome ### preserve ### destroy } his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right.
Matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the { mere ### absolute ### imaginary ### original ### enquiring } mystery.
He did { enable ### burn ### debate ### assure ### enter } the letter.
It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly { adopt ### reveal ### conceal ### derive ### attract } some traces of this mysterious individual.
Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket { apprehensive ### capable ### mindful ### half-full ### jealous } of water.
Colonel Lysander Stark { mapped ### sprang ### pointed ### poured ### galloped } out , and , as I followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.
It appears to be a fragment { torn ### glared ### rested ### suffered ### glanced } from a larger sheet.
It was not { threatened ### angry ### merely ### sorry ### ordained } that Holmes changed his costume.
And Holmes' { fears ### wretchedness ### dream ### worst ### departure } came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister German , or the morose Englishman.
The least appearance of { co-operation ### hers ### speech ### innocence ### opposition } struck fire out of the old autocrat.
The lash , however , was { thrown ### curled ### seized ### seated ### perched } upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
And yet if it were on the { lawn ### morrow ### undertaker ### contrary ### horizon } , I wonder that you did not hear it also.
This press , as I have already { elapsed ### gathered ### explained ### commenced ### loaded } , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject.
Of course , if they had been merely after { plunder ### sunset ### breakfast ### nightfall ### daylight } they would at least have made some attempt to search for it.
I rose , and , making my { society ### excuses ### meals ### circumstances ### occupation } , escaped from the house.
In one of these { occasions ### fables ### verses ### tests ### wings } the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin.
There are lonely houses { scattered ### lounging ### riding ### crowding ### glancing } over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing.
My coffee had not yet come , and I wondered what was the cause of the { hermit ### delay ### surroundings ### expedition ### rainbow } could be.
It brought me to the very { touch ### verge ### personification ### threshold ### mention } of the old door.
As I left the { card ### bucket ### pouch ### dining-room ### foreground } I happened to meet Rachel Howells , the maid.
One piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been { compressed ### dictated ### stimulated ### oppressed ### disconcerted } by some considerable weight.

My practice had steadily { increased ### concluded ### spoken ### reasoned ### consented } , and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station , I got a few patients from among the officials.
It rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my { patients ### desires ### nerves ### clothes ### edicts } were the only people who called.
Now , on the other side of this { narrow ### primitive ### surprising ### daily ### giant } wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.
The unknown might be lurking there , or he might be { counted ### written ### prowling ### arranged ### inflicted } on the moor.
My submission { abused ### fed ### devoured ### defended ### pleased } him and led him to further confidences.

Half way down this { island ### theory ### staircase ### barricade ### keyhole } is a small landing , with another passage running into it at right angles.
I placed my revolver , cocked , upon the top of the { unreasoning ### weary ### slightest ### law ### wooden } case behind which I crouched.

There was an old { clock ### mortal ### historic ### university ### skeleton } ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still.
The paper over each window was { wonderful ### averse ### prepared ### disproportionate ### impenetrable } to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front.

The younger had left us , but he suddenly returned through another door , leading with him a gentleman { seated ### born ### instructed ### believing ### clad } in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us.
He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people , with his { filaments ### manuscript ### horn ### neck ### fleet } stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime.
