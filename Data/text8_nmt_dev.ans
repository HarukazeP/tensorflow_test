has { survived } the scientific rigors of the past century in the eyes of most cosmologists
astrophysicists mond is considered a possible but unlikely alternative { to } the more widely
theory of dark matter as new { data } is collected
mond and dark matter { are } occaisionally invalidated and occasionally supported and no observation has yet conclusively settled the debate toward this goal
of mond have concentrated { their effort } on specific areas to determine phenomena predicted by mond and to search for them for example
dynamics of satellites of our galaxy could be distorted { by } the effects of mond in such a way
would be difficult { to } explain with a dark matter halo to obtain the relativistic extension of mond that would incidentally
scientists understand how light is bent { by } galaxies gravitational field although mond
currently cope with this teves has shown promise to otherwise establish { mond as a theory } of inertia and determine its
principles progress in this { direction has } been minimal another criticism of mond is that it
occam s razor which states that the { simplest } explanation is usually correct
modifications to newton s laws can also be { explained in } terms
distributions of dark matter { and the } second explanation is simpler in that it requires
changes to { rigorously established } scientific theory however proponents of mond are quick to point out that extremely
candidates { for } dark matter such as wimps six dimensional dark matter theories and the general requirement that dark matter
evenly distributed through { space } are no simpler than the idea that gravity acts differently

opioids methadone was introduced into the united states in one nine { four seven } by eli lilly and
as an analgesic { they gave it } the trade name dolophine which is now registered to roxane laboratories since then it

for methadone when actually it is the reverse may also { use } the old brand name methadone has a slow metabolism and very

some heroin addicts feel that it is actually harder to quit methadone than { heroin }
{ treatment at a } methadone maintenance clinic is intended to be for an indefinite duration as the treatment is not curative
recent years methadone has gained popularity among physicians { for the } treatment of chronic pain the increased usage comes as doctors search for
opioid drug that can be dosed less frequently than { short acting } drugs such as

m { bius } inversion formula was introduced into number theory during the one nine th century by august
m bius it was later generalized { to } other m bius inversion formulas
incidence algebra the classic version states { that } if g n and f n are arithmetic functions
g n { sum f d } quad mboxn ge one then f n sum g d mu
d quad mboxn ge one where is the m bius function and the sums { extend over } all
divisors { d of } n in effect the original f n can be
given g n by using the { inversion } formula the two sequences
said to be m bius transforms of each other the formula is also correct if { f } and
are { functions } from the positive integers into some abelian
in the language of { convolutions } see multiplicative function and dirichlet convolution
inversion formula can also be expressed as one an equivalent formulation of { the } inversion formula
useful in combinatorics is as follows suppose f x and { g } x are complex valued functions defined on the
one such that g x { sum f } x n quad mboxx ge one then
x sum mu n g { x } n quad mboxx ge one here
sums extend over all { positive } integers n which are less than or equal to x the m bius
{ treated } above is the original m bius inversion when the partially ordered set of natural numbers ordered by divisibility one
replaced by other locally finite partially ordered sets one has other m bius inversion { formulas } for

the { suffix cracy } implies a system of government based on rule
ability merit rather than by wealth race or other determinants of social position { however } the word meritocracy is
often used to describe a type of society { where }
income and social status are assigned through competition on the assumption that the winners { do } indeed deserve merit their resulting advantage
a result { the } word has acquired a connotation of social darwinism and is used to describe aggressively
societies with large inequality of income and wealth contrasted with egalitarian societies meritocratic governments and organizations { stress }
formal education and competence rather than existing differences such as { social } class ethnicity
sex in practice research on social mobility indicates that all these { supposedly } neutral criteria

overthrow the elite who have become arrogant and { disconnected } from the feelings of the public
the negative origin { of the } word there are many who believe that a meritocratic system
a good thing for society proponents of meritocracy argue that a meritocratic { system is more } just
more productive than other systems and that it allows for an end to { distinctions } based on such things as sex
race though social classes would still exist young s central criticism of meritocracy { was that } a system in which social position
determined by { objective characteristics would } still be inegalitarian and unstable there have since been other lines
criticism proponents of critical theory { often } argue that merit is defined by the power
simply to legitimise a system in which social status is actually { determined by } class birth
wealth { often opponents of } the concept of meritocracy argue that characteristics such as intelligence or effort are
impossible { to } measure accurately for example one may ask who was more intelligent isaac newton or albert einstein therefore in their
{ any } implementation of meritocracy necessarily involves a high degree of guesswork and is inherently flawed social darwinism social darwinism is
social theory which holds that darwin s theory { of } evolution by natural
is not only a model for the { development of } biological traits in a population but can also be applied to
social institutions social darwinisim was popular in { the late } one
th century to the { end } of world war ii although some have claimed that contemporary sociobiology
be classified as a form of social darwinism proponents of social { darwinism } often used
{ theory } to justify social inequality as being meritocratic others
it to justify racism and imperialism at { its most } extreme some social darwinism appears to anticipate eugenics
the race doctrines of the nazis while social darwinism applies the { concept }
evolution and natural selection to human cultural { systems } none of the political and
theological ideologies related to { it } are a part of darwin s
theory of evolution equally social darwinism { itself } does not necessarily engender a political position some social darwinists
for the inevitability of progress while others { emphasize } the potential for the degeneration of humanity some
attempted to enroll social darwinism in reformist { politics } the theory of social darwinism draws on

another two millennia { although after } the qin dynasty it was heavily diluted genghis khan meritocracy was
primary basis for { selection } of chiefs and generals in the mongol empire genghis
chose whomever was talented and fit for his military chain of command { he even } trusted generals and soldiers

to aspire to be a pure meritocracy with its supposed { emphasis on }

as objective measures of both intelligence and effort { which } in

people s action { party } its unwillingness to tolerate political dissent casts some
on its claims of meritocracy and within its { party } ideology political conformity is a measure of merit thereby distorting its original meaning
is supposed to be a central political concept { in } singapore and is at the heart of
founding myth specifically singapore portrays itself as having been expelled from neighbouring malaysia in one nine { six } five as a
of the unwillingness of its majority immigrant groups { especially } the ethnic
to accept the special position of the indigenous { communities especially the malays the }
malaysian government had argued for a system which would { give special } privileges to the
as part of their birthright as an indigenous people { in time }

senior { members } of the people s action party are

western civilization the anglosphere and western europe western { civilization } as a whole is based largely
principles of meritocracy the { primary } difference between the anglosphere and western
being that anglophone countries focus on merit regardless { of inherited } advantages while continental
prefer to assess merit after giving roughly the same opportunities to everyone the principles of { equality } under the law the
of common law { the prevalence of the market } system which rewards merit however
the democratic system whereby citizens { can choose those they } believe
be of the greatest merit and the strong constitutional emphasis on individual rights are all unique { developments } of western
which have the effect { of } approximating meritocracy better than traditional civilizations although a
{ exists } between those who believe that everyone should have the same opportunities and
who believe the { most capable should } rule regardless of how

about the changing use { of } the term forms of government political neologisms
leninism russian strictly speaking { refers to } the version of marxist theory developed by vladimir
{ see } leninism however in various contexts different and sometimes opposing political groups have used the term
leninism to describe { the } ideologies that they claimed to be upholding
purpose of this article is to { give } an account of
historical and present { uses of the } label marxism leninism history of the
{ lenin himself never } used the term leninism nor did
refer to his views as marxism leninism however his ideas diverged { from } classical marxist theory on several important points see the articles
marxism and leninism for more information bolshevik communists saw { these } differences
advancements of marxism { made by } lenin after lenin s death his ideology and contributions
marxist theory were { termed marxism leninism } or sometimes only leninism
leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the comintern and of communist { parties } around the world
five years of lenin s death joseph stalin completed his { rise } to power in the soviet
stalin in contrast to many contemporary revolutionaries { did } not write a significant body of theoretical work
strictly { speaking refers to a } style of government or political structure rather
an ideology per { se } during the period of stalin s rule in the
union marxism { leninism was } proclaimed the official ideology of the state whether
s practices actually followed the principles of marx and lenin is still a { subject } of debate
historians and political scientists trotskyists in particular believe that stalinism contradicted authentic marxism and leninism and { they }
used the term bolshevik leninism to describe their { own } ideology of anti stalinist and anti maoist communism after the
soviet split the soviet union and the people s { republic of } china
claimed to be the { sole intellectual heir } to marxism leninism in china the
that { mao had adapted } marxism leninism to chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had
{ it in } a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole consequently the term marxism
mao zedong thought commonly { known } as maoism was increasingly used to describe the
chinese state ideology { as } well as the ideological basis of parties
the world who sympathized with the communist party of china following the death of mao { american maoists }
with the revolutionary communist party usa subsequently coined the term marxism { leninism maoism } arguing
maoism was a { more advanced } stage of marxism maoist and maoist oriented parties today generally believe
{ the current leadership } of china has abandoned maoism in north korea marxism leninism was officially
in one nine seven seven by juche in which { concepts } of class and class struggle in other words
itself play { no } significant role however the government is still sometimes referred to
marxist leninist or more commonly stalinist due to its political and economic { structure } see history of north korea the other
communist states existing today cuba vietnam and laos hold marxism leninism as their official { ideology although } they
it { different } interpretations in terms of practical policy current usage most
{ parties } continue to regard marxism leninism as their basic ideology although many
modified { it to adapt to new } political conditions several communist parties
those previously associated with { eurocommunism } have distanced themselves from the concept of marxism leninism and in
{ cases omitted } it from their official documents some have started identifying themselves as marxist
or { marxist and leninist } rather than marxist leninist the difference in
cases is that the historical connotation of marxism leninism { is } avoided in
names the appellation marxist leninist is normally used by a communist { party }
wishes to distinguish itself from some other and { presumably mainstream } communist party in the
country most often parties who place the term marxist leninist in their official name are { those originating } from the anti revisionist tradition
as maoist groups popular confusion abounds concerning the complex { terminology } describing the various schools of marxist

b modulo n means that a and b have the same { remainder } when divided by n or equivalently that
b is a multiple of n for more { details see } modular arithmetic in computing given two

united { states } military units to recall the success and patriotism of
originals see minutemen history as early as one { six four } five in the massachusetts bay colony some men were selected from
general ranks of town based training bands to be ready for rapid { deployment the } militia
the province of massachusetts had a long history of extended conflict { see }
philip s war french and indian wars and battle of lexington and { concord } every generation
{ new englander } had known fighting every town had a militia and every
between one six and { six } zero years of age was asked to join
of these men were farmers many were { descendants of } the
original settlers of each town and so it was very { common to } be fighting alongside cousins and
laws some towns in massachusetts had { a } long history of
a portion of their militia as minutemen but others prefered to keep their entire militia in a { single unit after }
powder alarm in the fall of one seven seven four patriot leaders in the newly { formed } massachusetts provincial
recommended that all militias contain minute companies special units within the militia system whose members { underwent additional } training and to hold themselves
{ to turn } out quickly at a minute s notice for emergencies some towns followed this recommendation
altered their unit structures but { some } took no action the minutemen were usually two five years
age or younger and they were { chosen for } their enthusiasm reliability and strength they were the first armed militia to arrive
await a battle officers were { elected } by popular vote and each unit drafted a formal
covenant to be signed upon enlistment they typically assembled four times per { year for training } during peacetime it was
sometimes even in the middle of battle for officers to make decisions through consultation { with } their men as opposed to giving orders
be followed without question popular histories { of the battle } of lexington and concord
one seven seven five the first battle of the american revolutionary { war have often } labelled all the irregulars on
american side { as } minutemen most notably captain john parker s lexington militia
at the time of the battle { all of lexington s } militiamen were organized into
single large { unit } and were still called by the archaic name of town
band other colonies faced with similar problems had organized similar { minute companies } over
minutemen became a { generic term } for any american militia motivation the new england town meeting style of local decision
in combination with { the colonial legislature } meant that for nearly all functions of
these men had already experienced generations { of } self rule even though most of
could not express lofty sentiments about the rights of { man and }
purposes of government they knew that the { same } british army of professional soldiers who had once fought with them against
common enemy was now in their land to take { something important }
from them one massachusetts man used the phrase an englishman s { home } is his castle when he
to his friends why he had barricaded himself behind his front door to { fight } the british army
it passed by during { the } final phase of the battle of lexington and concord the typical individual american patriot in massachusetts fought
a political idea even at this first stage of { the } war when independence from great britain
not yet a common sentiment equipment { training and tactics } most colonial militia units
provided neither arms { nor } uniforms and so had to equip themselves many
wore their own farmers { or } workmans clothes while others had buckskin hunting outfits some
indian style touches to intimidate the enemy even including war paint most used { hunting } rifles which
not have bayonets but were accurate at long range the continental army regulars received european style { military } training later in
american revolutionary war but the militias did { not } get much of this rather than fight formal battles
the traditional dense lines and { columns } they were better when used as irregulars
as skirmishers and sharpshooters their experience suited irregular warfare most were familiar with frontier hunting { the }
wars and { especially } the recent french and indian war had taught both the
and officers the value of irregular warfare while many british { troops } fresh from europe were less familiar with this the wilderness terrain
lay just beyond many colonial { towns } very familiar to the local minuteman favored
style of combat the rifled musket used { by } most minutemen was
well suited to { this } role the rifling grooves inside the barrel gave it a much greater range than the smoothbore musket although
took { much } longer to load because of the lower rate of fire rifles weren
{ used by } regular infantry but were preferred for hunting when performing as skirmishers the minutemen could
and fall back { behind } cover or other troops before the british could get into range the increased range and accuracy
the rifle along { with a lifetime } of hunting to develop marksmanship
minutemen sharpshooters { a } deadly reputation ammunition and supplies were not only in short demand
were constantly being seized by british patrols as a precaution these items { were } often hidden
left behind by minutemen in fields or wooded areas { other } popular concealment methods

organization of the minute men american revolutionary war militias masada is a { latin corruption } of the hebrew name metzada
from the word metzuda { meaning } fortress it is the site of ancient palaces and fortifications in israel on top of
isolated rock plateau on the eastern edge of the { judean } desert overlooking
dead { sea } masada became famous for the seven three ce battle one of the last in
great { jewish revolt between } the site s jewish defenders and besieging roman troops
which almost all surviving defenders committed mass suicide when defeat { became } imminent geography masada seen from the east dovecote
masada where { ashes } were probably stored the openings have been shown to be too small for
to fit the cliffs on the east edge of masada are about four five { zero } meters
dropping off to the { dead sea } and the cliffs on
west are about one zero { zero meters high the } natural approaches to the
top are very difficult the top { of the plateau } is flat and rhomboid shaped approximately
zero zero by three zero { zero } meters there was a casemate wall around
top { of } the plateau totalling one four zero zero meters long and
meters thick with many { towers } and the fortress included storehouses cisterns that were
by rainwater barracks palaces and an armory { three narrow }
paths led from below { to fortified } gates location history according to flavius josephus a one
century jewish historian herod the great fortified masada { between } three seven and three one bce as a refuge for
should his { jewish subjects } rise up against him in six six ce at the beginning of the great
revolt against the romans a { group of } jewish rebels called the
heb kana im lit jealous ones commanded by elazar ben ya ir took masada from { the } roman
stationed there in seven zero ce they were joined by { additional } zealots and
families who were expelled from jerusalem { by } the other jews
there shortly before the destruction of jerusalem and for the next { two years used }
as their base for raiding and harassing roman and jewish settlements alike { remnants of one }
several legionary camps at masada just outside the circumvallation wall { which can } be seen next to it
in seven two ce the roman { governor of iudaea } province
flavius silva { marched against masada } with the roman legion x fretensis and laid
to { the fortress } after failed attempts to breach the wall they built a
wall and then a rampart { against } the western face of
plateau using thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth josephus does not record any major { attempts } by the
to { counterattack } the besiegers during this process a significant difference from his accounts of
sieges against jewish fortresses suggesting that perhaps the zealots lacked the equipment or skills to fight { the } roman legion it is
by many that the romans used { jewish slaves to }
{ the } rampart whom the zealots were reluctant to kill because of their beliefs a shot
the ramp from the { top } the ramp was complete in the spring of
{ three ce } after approximately two to three months of siege allowing the
to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram when { they entered } the
however the romans discovered that { its } approximately one thousand defenders had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze
committed mass suicide rather than face certain capture or defeat by their { enemies because } the jewish religion discourages the act of suicide
the defenders were reported to have drawn lots and slain each { other in turn } down to the
man who would { be the only } one to actually take his own life
per josephus account the argument is made that the { storerooms were } left standing
show that { the defenders retained } the ability to live and chose the time of
death this { account of } the siege of masada was apparently related to josephus by two women who
