Music has always been a great love of mine and, in my 20s, when my { loneliness ### sadness ### tiredness ### sickness } was more manageable , I enjoyed ten years as a professional singer in restaurants, playing and singing folk songs .
Music has always been a great love of mine and, in my 20s, when my sickness was more manageable , I { set ### enjoyed ### kept ### shared } ten years as a professional singer in restaurants, playing and singing folk songs .
 { Gladly ### Finally ### Unfortunately ### Surprisingly } that was years ago and times have changed.
 { Now ### Then ### Sometime ### Meanwhile } I live with mother on a country farm.
 { If ### As ### Though ### Before } I needed to sleep in the afternoons, I was limited in my choices.
My family are all musicians, so I was { recognized ### interviewed ### found ### invited } when I went into our local music store.
I knew that discs were very expensive and I really didn't have a lot of { money ### time ### energy ### knowledge } to get started.
And often you find only three to four songs out of ten on a disc that you can { actually ### hardly ### nearly ### mainly } use.
When I told the owner of the shop about my { job ### family ### idea ### offer } ; he gave me a long thoughtful actually .
When I told the owner of the shop about my money ; he gave me a long thoughtful { face ### view ### look ### sight } .
He led me { over ### along ### towards ### through } the crowded shop and to a bench with a large professional karaoke box on it.
He placed his large hand { unhappily ### lovingly ### pitifully ### gratefully } on his treasure and said, I have 800 karaoke songs in here.
His { courage ### happiness ### kindness ### trust } still warms my heart and makes me do just that bit extra, when I have the chance.
Yesterday afternoon Misty and I were sitting on the grass { when ### as ### while ### before } the girls were playing at the park.
We saw a(an) { young ### elderly ### helpful ### powerful } man pushing a shopping cart and struggling with each step he took.
On two different occasions, I heard him telling people that he was lost and I felt { excited ### confident ### sad ### happy } as I noticed these people pay no attention to what he said .
On two different occasions, I heard him telling people that he was lost and I felt sad as I noticed these people pay no attention to { that ### what ### which ### how } he said .
After thinking about it for a moment, I { decided ### replied ### imagined ### realized } that he probably had dementia .
I walked over to him and asked him if he knew { who ### which ### why ### where } he was.
He said that he didn't know. I asked his { name ### address ### age ### hobby } , and he told me his name was Ray.
At this point, I walked over to Misty and told her what the { decision ### opinion ### conversation ### discussion } was about and she called the police to let them know the situation.
I walked back over to him and offered him { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } to drink.
He agreed and as soon as he started to walk { under ### with ### without ### by } the support of the shopping cart, he was very unsteady on his feet.
I was so happy that God { provided ### lent ### offered ### presented } us the chance to do just what he would have done--the right thing and the loving thing.
I had to walk home since all the { work ### life ### traffic ### business } had stopped after the quake.
On my way home I { missed ### caught ### noticed ### heard } an old Japanese lady at the bakery shop who was giving out free bread, which made my heart warm .
On my way home I noticed an old Japanese lady at the bakery shop who was giving out free bread, which made my heart { kind ### soft ### broken ### warm } .
A middle-aged Japanese man was holding a sign that said, Please use our { toilet ### hotel ### hospital ### house } .
He stood in the cold with a sign If you are okay with a motorcycle, I will { drive ### follow ### lead ### send } you to your house.
Then the next day I drove to { start ### fill ### check ### wash } my car with gas.
There is a lack gas now and many gasoline stations were either closed or had very { direct ### fine ### long ### thin } lines.
Finally, when it was my { time ### turn ### duty ### decision } , the man smiled and said, Because of this situation, we are only giving $ 30 worth gas per person.
Is that alright? Of course, I'm just glad that we are all able to { share ### offer ### learn ### choose } , I said.
I saw a man at the evacuation center { singing ### eating ### smiling ### crying } when people brought food to him, It was the first time in three days that food has been brought to their center.
However, after he wiped the tears, his next { words ### roles ### ways ### promises } surprised me.
I am very { sure ### grateful ### surprised ### proud } that we are provided with food.
But people in the city next to us haven't { bought ### wasted ### prepared ### received } any food at all.
And when hearing that, I realized there is a bright future on the other side of this { disaster ### chance ### center ### city } .
He { played ### came ### arrived ### walked } back last week.
He came to { visit ### teach ### discuss ### find } me yesterday and gave me a nice hat.
He said he had a great { job ### report ### sleep ### time } in New York.
He and his parents visited many { interesting ### excited ### delicious ### boring } places and went shopping there.
Lin Tao { never ### usually ### also ### always } went to his pen pal's home for the first time.
He didn't know the { news ### way ### number ### price } to his friend's house.
A friendly American boy { asked ### wanted ### helped ### needed } him to find it at last.
He could { speak ### say ### tell ### talk } a little Chinese, because he had a trip to China last year.
Lin Tao and Jimmy talked { on ### to ### in ### for } English and Chinese.
Lin Tao had dinner with Jimmy's family. They took many photos with a { map ### cinema ### book ### camera } .
I saw a young homeless man { asking ### calling ### disturbing ### kidnapping } people for money so he could buy breakfast.
Most of the { guests ### audience ### neighbours ### travelers } simply took no notice of the young man or gave him a dirty look.
When the young homeless man moved { from ### after ### before ### over } this elegant lady, she turned and looked straight into his eyes and softly asked, How much do you need ?
When the young homeless man moved after this elegant lady, she turned and looked straight into his eyes and { softly ### sadly ### loudly ### hopefully } asked, How much do you need ?
I couldn't hear what the young man said but watched { because ### unless ### as ### although } the old man pulled several bills from her wallet and softly them in the young man's hands .
I couldn't hear what the young man said but watched after the old man pulled several bills from her wallet and { cheeked ### put ### covered ### threw } them in the young man's hands .
What I do know is that I saw two completely different reactions to the same { location ### survey ### situation ### programme } .
And then I saw this old lady who { ordered ### treated ### required ### recommended } the homeless man as her brother.
I decided then and there that, even though we have to be { famous ### creative ### careful ### successful } in this world, I would rather be like her.
Every day may bring us many chances for { richness ### happiness ### fitness ### Kindness } .
They are in England. Mrs. King is { a ### an ### the ### / } Chinese teacher.

Tom and David like { school ### teachers ### Chinese ### football } and they play it every day.
I felt my life was { hopeless ### colourful ### simple ### wonderful } , for my whole world was dark.
A young boy ran up to me, out of { mind ### trouble ### breath ### work } .
He stood right before me with his head down and said { sadly ### strictly ### angrily ### excitedly } , Look what I found!
In his hand was a flower, and what a poor sight! The flower was dry and { dead ### fresh ### alive ### heavy } .
 { So ### Or ### However ### And } , he sat next to my side and placed the flower to his nose and said in surprise, It smells sweet and it's beautiful, too .
 However , he sat next to my side and placed the flower to his { head ### nose ### ear ### neck } and said in surprise, It smells sweet and it's beautiful, too .
That's { how ### when ### where ### why } I picked it.
But I knew I must { buy ### sell ### accept ### break } it, or he might never leave.
So I accepted the flower, and replied, This is just what I { admire ### dislike ### want ### have } .
Just then, for the first time I noticed that the boy could not { cry ### speak ### smile ### see } --he was blind.
Tears came down my face as I { forgave ### thanked ### paid ### hated } him for picking the best one.
You're welcome. he smiled, and then ran off to { sleep ### study ### dance ### play } .
And for all those years I myself had been { cheerful ### useful ### blind ### deaf } .
I decided to see the beauty in life, and { waste ### enjoy ### lose ### forget } every second of my life.
About 20minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the { kitchen ### study ### bedroom ### bathroom } .
So I took a stack of cards and a pencil and wrote, If you don't want to { talk ### listen ### know ### see } , we can write notes to each other.
An hour later I was { again ### surely ### still ### angrily } sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me.
One was blank and the other was cards { for ### from ### about ### of } Kevin on which he had translated all his unpleasant feelings into words for me.
 { Because ### Though ### So ### As } I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes.
It said, { Nobody ### Anybody ### Somebody ### Everybody } in this family cares about me, I'm not clever.
And you're never around to even { call ### praise ### help ### notice } me.
It was { strange ### true ### funny ### wrong } what he had said about me.
I am here for you and you are { understood ### proved ### loved ### protected } in this family.
Since then, I try my best to { never ### ever ### only ### yet } half notice my family members any more.
Kevin and I have a closer { friendship ### connection ### relationship ### touch } now, and sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset we'll smile and say Write it on a paper cup.

But she'll be { pressed ### occupied ### left ### painted } with scars on her head, and of course her hair won't grow there.
As a child, I cared much about my scars, so I { possibly ### usually ### finally ### nearly } wore a scarf to cover them up when I left home.
 { Although ### Since ### If ### Before } I didn't, people would call me horrible names like Baldy.
Although my friends were always comforting me ,they never { correctly ### roughly ### easily ### really } understood how it felt.
Then through the hospital I was { promoted ### introduced ### reported ### carried } to a children's burns camp, where children like me can get any help.
There, I { met ### recognized ### remembered ### caught } 14-year-old Stephanie, whose burns are a lot more serious than mine.
But she is so { honest ### strong ### active ### young } that she never lets anyone put her down.
You shouldn't listen to what people say about what you look like because we're not different from anyone else, Holly, she { promised ### encouraged ### ordered ### calmed } me.
And you don't need to wear a scarf because y0ou look great { in ### for ### without ### beyond } it!
For the first time in my life I could speak to someone who'd been through something { similar ### strange ### hard ### important } .
So weeks later, at my 13th birthday party, { allowed ### required ### guided ### inspired } by her bravery, I gave up my scarf and showed off my scars.
It felt amazing not having to { hide ### give ### keep ### put } away behind my scarf.
Now, I am { sick ### aware ### tired ### proud } of what I look like and much happier, because I have realized it is your personality that decides who you truly are.

A recent survey { thinks ### takes ### shows ### realizes } that many French kids spend their time as other kids always have.
Most French teens love music, with 86% putting it as their top { plan ### housework ### search ### hobby } , above the cinema, sport and television .

As Silvia Berlin, a student from Paris, says, I love watching American TV after school, { but ### and ### so ### or } I watch more French programs .
She would { hate ### enjoy ### practise ### remember } shooting over and over again, sometimes until dark.
One day I asked her { how ### when ### where ### why } she practiced so hard.
I want to play for the top basketball team. I want to be the { best ### tallest ### cleverest ### kindest } .
I watched her { through ### by ### across ### for } those high school years.
The coach told her that she was too { thin ### fat ### tall ### short } to play for a top team.
She was very { happy ### sad ### lazy ### excited } .
I asked her if she had talked to her { players ### teacher ### dad ### coach } about it yet.
She told me that her father said those coaches were { good ### wrong ### strong ### gentle } .
They just did not understand the power of a { dream ### team ### fact ### father } .
He told her that nothing could { follow ### fight ### protect ### stop } her but one thing-her own attitude -if she really wanted to play for a good basketball team .

Jim saw a trainer near the elephants. Then he walked over and asked him { what ### when ### why ### where } .

Jim thought a lot { at ### in ### about ### to } that.
These animals could break their ropes at any time, but because they { agreed ### forgot ### meant ### believed } they couldn't, they didn't give it a try.
Like the { man ### elephants ### ropes ### trainer } many of us believe that we can't do something in our life, just because we didn't do it successfully in the past.

It was a rainy afternoon, Xiao Ling, my best friend, and I were { on ### in ### with ### for } duty.
We had to { cleaning ### cleaned ### clean ### cleans } the desks and chairs, wash the doors and windows, and sweep the school floor.
We worked hard { when ### if ### after ### until } it was getting dark.
After we finished our work, we realized that we hadn't brought our umbrellas to school { because ### though ### while ### however } it wasn't raining then.
All of our classmates, { without ### except ### besides ### unless } Xiao Ling and me, were taken home by their parents.
 { Everybody ### Somebody ### Nobody ### Anybody } noticed us and we felt lonely and afraid.
She asked Xiao Ling to go with her. But Xiao Ling { wouldn't ### hasn't ### wasn't ### doesn't } do.
I was so { interested ### moved ### sad ### lonely } that tears came into my eyes.
When I got home, the rain stopped. A ray of colorful { sunshine ### wind ### rain ### snow } came out.
I'd heard the famous saying A friend in { danger ### trouble ### need ### sick } is a friend indeed before, but not until this time did I understand its real meaning.
But it was when I got tired of { seeing ### throwing ### dropping ### cleaning } litter nearby and realized that no one else was going to pick it up.
I can walk there { after ### for ### with ### in } three minutes.I used to love going there to play with my dog.
But one day there was { such ### very ### so ### too } much litter there that I became very unhappy.
I wanted to { make ### feel ### look ### find } happy going there again.

Chinese children hope very much to go { abroad ### foreign ### home ### school } to get a wider view of the world.
In a talk Chen told more than 300 parents and their children that life in foreign countries can be { easy ### happy ### sad ### hard } for young people.
To most children looking after themselves when studying alone in a foreign country is a big { challenge ### thought ### difference ### change } .
To his surprise, his teachers there { ever ### always ### hardly ### almost } pushed students to study.
And { yet ### usually ### just ### never } there wasn't homework.
With these education systems , we have more { safe ### busy ### boring ### spare } time and more space for thinking.
But if you don't know how to { take ### plan ### use ### have } your time and money, you will not have an easy time.
Studying abroad at a young age can help students learn a foreign language { carefully ### quickly ### happily ### exactly } and open up their eyes, but students and parents should know about the challenges, Chen said.
 { Unless ### Whether ### If ### While } you want to study abroad, try to talk to someone with experience in foreign countries .

The couple moved { quickly ### slowly ### freely ### excitedly } around me in search of things they had on a list.
Can I help you { buy ### carry ### find ### introduce } something?
They stopped, looked at me and said, We're looking for { small ### lovely ### cheap ### old } things that look new.
Every year in the past, we tried to { begin ### spend ### finish ### accept } the year with new things.
It was a goal to have new things around us so that we had a new { action ### competition ### direction ### instruction } , new hopes and dreams for the new year, said the old man.
But nowadays we also believe that even though something is old, it { must ### can ### should ### will } be new to someone who has never seen it before.
So, at the end of each year we search for things that are { useful ### strange ### real ### expensive } to no one but new to us, the old woman added.
Got it! I heard a loud { noise ### cry ### laugh ### shout } .
The old woman walked slowly towards us { getting ### taking ### holding ### keeping } something in her hand.
Look! It's a flower vase. Well, it looks { wonderful ### awful ### beautiful ### shiny } , but it's new to us!

At least that was what I had told him-- actually I had an important question to ask--that had been on my mind for a couple of weeks and this was the first time I had been able to { stay ### fight ### live ### argue } with him alone .
Dad... I started. And { laughed ### continued ### stopped ### cried } .
They say I'm { honest ### wrong ### proud ### foolish } to believe in Father Christmas anymore...it's only for little kids.
But I believe what you told me. Father Christmas is { real ### proper ### kind ### right } .
The real life and spirit of this magical elf lives forever in your heart, my heart, Mom's heart and in the hearts and minds of { every ### some ### few ### all } people who believe in the joy that giving to others brings.
The real { spirit ### position ### character ### life } of Father Christmas becomes what you can give rather what you get.

My heart was filled with pride and I'm sure my eyes were shining with { fear ### excitement ### panic ### surprise } .
You're the best Father Christmas who has { still ### yet ### ever ### already } been in the whole world.
When it comes time in my life to { explain ### solve ### introduce ### describe } the reality of Father Christmas to my children, I hope that I will be as eloquent and trying as my dad was the day I learned that the spirit of Father Christmas doesn't wear a red excitement .

But it never had any importance in my life until I { bought ### received ### borrowed ### broke } a watch from my father that made me responsible .
It { learned ### found ### sent ### told } me the importance of time in my life.
I had to go to the { airport ### school ### hospital ### station } at 9:00 a.m. to pick up my uncle Ali and take him to my father's house.
However, I forgot it { when ### because ### if ### though } I was playing with my friends.
Later on that day, around 11:00 a.m., I { saw ### forgot ### remembered ### took } my uncle, but I was late for him.
He had got out of the plane and { had ### driven ### invited ### taken } a taxi to my father's house.
I { visited ### reminded ### reached ### left } my father's house at 2:00 p.m. at the same day .
My father looked at me angrily. I said hi to him and my { surprised ### tired ### nervous ### lonely } uncle.
My father asked me to sit next to him and handed me this watch which was a gift from { us ### him ### them ### you } .
Then he said, Essa, did you have fun { of ### for ### with ### about } your friends today?
What you did was not very nice and you should be sorry for your { words ### actions ### play ### fun } .
I hope today you have learned something { important ### interesting ### expensive ### wonderful } .
I learned a lesson from my father: to respect time and { never ### usually ### sometimes ### often } be late.
The watch is important to me, not because of its { look ### price ### size ### weight } , but because of the lesson that I learned from it.
Once he was hurt, everybody at Boston University was { sorry ### afraid ### alone ### tired } .
People all over the country { thought ### talked ### heard ### moved } about John Thomas and often asked, Will he ever jump again?
John's mother went to the hospital to see her son. She looked at his { broken ### lost ### missing ### dead } leg.
Then she looked into his { arms ### feet ### eyes ### legs } .
She knew what her son would { make ### use ### agree ### do } .
You're going to jump again, John, I know it, she said. { Nothing ### Anything ### Something ### Everything } will be all right.
If John hoped to jump again, he would have a { little ### lot ### few ### bit } to do.
Soon his { chair ### classroom ### home ### bed } looked like a machine shop!
It was May when John { reached ### called ### left ### found } the hospital.
But take care of that foot. John took only { short ### long ### quick ### fast } walks at first.
He exercised { after ### if ### before ### when } his body cried for a rest.
Some days later, he exercised a little { later ### better ### more ### less } .
In late summer John went back to { school ### hospital ### shop ### church } .
Football wasn't his favorite, but he had to get that leg { thick ### strong ### straight ### hard } again!
To { look ### hear ### know ### see } a champion fighting back is a wonderful thing to watch.
People { enjoyed ### avoided ### forgot ### considered } coming into such a dirty place and the poor man was lonely and sad every day.
One day, the poor man dropped in on a wise old man and asked him for { service ### knowledge ### advice ### care } about changing his life.
The old man gave him a beautiful vase and said, This is a magic vase that will bring you { peace ### happiness ### mess ### regret } .
The poor man looked at the vase { sadly ### nervously ### proudly ### surprisedly } .
It.s not right for something so beautiful to be { ugly ### Full ### empty ### dirty } .
 { Although ### But ### So ### Because } he was still not satisfied .
His house turned into { large ### dark ### strange ### comfortable } place immediately.

That day we not only enjoyed the { beauty ### beautiful ### careful ### endless } of the Great Wall, but also felt the warmth of the society.
If { nobody ### everyone ### nothing ### Something } can give a helping hand to others, the world around us will be more beautiful.
They spend the { quickly ### long ### fast ### short } breaks running, playing, and shouting happily before going back to the classroom again.
But { where ### what ### why ### how } should students spend their free time outside school?
Students can make their own { times ### money ### time ### homework } and learn more about the real world .
 { Because ### And ### However ### Although } , it seems that, in China, parents worry so much about their children's studies that they would prefer to see their children taking most of their free time studying and preparing for all those exams .
 However , it seems that, in China, parents { know ### talk ### worry ### complain } so much about their children's studies that they would prefer to see their children taking most of their free time studying and preparing for all those exams .

 However , it seems that, in China, parents worry so much about their children's studies that they would prefer to see their children taking most of their free time studying and preparing for all those { games ### competitions ### exams ### matches } .
It is natural for { students ### teachers ### children ### parents } to feel that way in China, but I believe the answer lies in balance.
Sometimes, Western school children work { long ### short ### free ### little } hours after school to make money, and so they become too tired to listen in class or have no time for homework.
But Chinese students spend { such ### so ### very ### too } much time exams their studies that all else becomes less important until they want that new MP4 player .
But Chinese students spend taking much time { in ### to ### on ### at } their studies that all else becomes less important until they want that new MP4 player .
If you have a part-time job, you'll be { happy ### tired ### nervous ### busy } , and your parents will also be happy exams you're spending the money you make and not theirs !

Because she is { new ### old ### quiet ### busy } there, she doesn't know Beijing well(know...well......).
She { has ### asks ### needs ### thinks } some help.
Look! She's { asking ### coming ### taking ### arriving } a policeman for help.
Policeman: Sure! Go down this road, and { have ### take ### turn ### pass } left at the second street.
Go along Chang'an Jie, and the Forbidden City is { in ### Across ### for ### on } the right.
Miss White: Thank you a lot. Policeman: You're { right ### good ### welcome ### well } .
One day her parents went away { in ### at ### on ### with } business, so she had to stay at home alone.
At first she thought she would be happy { so ### because ### but ### until } her parents were not in.
She could do everything { that ### who ### where ### when } she liked.
But it was six o'clock in the afternoon, she felt { hungry ### full ### excited ### bored } .
At that moment, she missed her { cousin ### aunt ### brother ### parents } very much.
At last she could only go to the supermarket and { made ### bought ### gave ### saw } some food to eat.
So I think they should learn some basic life skills, like cooking, tidying up their rooms or dressing themselves { actually ### carelessly ### properly ### slowly } .
We like hamburgers for lunch. Grace and { me ### I ### my ### I'm } like French fries, but Alice doesn't .
We like hamburgers for lunch. Grace and I like French fries, { and ### so ### or ### but } Alice doesn't .
I really like chicken and vegetables. My parents like vegetables, { also ### to ### two ### too } .
So there are always { any ### some ### a ### an } vegetables too the fridge .
So there are always but vegetables { on ### at ### in ### near } the fridge .
We each eat one every day. But there { isn't ### is ### aren't ### are } any apples today.
So I will go to the shop with my mother { when ### at ### before ### after } school.
When I had something { difficult ### glad ### good ### happy } to do, I used to ask my mother for help.
But she always { spoke ### talked ### said ### asked } , Do it yourself, dear.
I was not { old ### glad ### thin ### sad } at all.
For example, one day, I decided to { leave ### invite ### visit ### take } some friends to my home.
And I didn't make the bed. I ask my { mother ### father ### brother ### sister } to help me clean it, but she still said, Do it yourself , girl .
And I didn't make the bed. I ask my mother to help me clean it, but she still said, Do it { you ### your ### yourself ### yourselves } , girl .
I even have to go to the dentist by { me ### themselves ### myself ### mother } .
It is really { hard ### easy ### good ### happy } for me to do everything well, but I have learnt a lot .
As time goes by, I { hate ### understand ### dislike ### forget } my mother.
She makes me clever and diligent . { What ### How ### Who ### Which } a great mother!
A(An) { young ### old ### good ### happy } mother is worth one hundred teachers!
Soon it was time { in ### at ### for ### with } lunch.
A few minutes later, he came back again but he couldn't find the { mice ### table ### workers ### bread } .
Who { eat ### ate ### drink ### drank } the bread on the table?
he shouted. Some of the workers answered, We { did ### didn't ### do ### does } .
So I put some poison in the bread. If they eat, they will { live ### living ### die ### dead } .
asked Mr. Smith. We ate the bread when you { is ### are ### was ### were } out.
Don't worry, Mr. Smith said { with ### for ### in ### on } a smile.
She likes dancing and singing and { spends ### costs ### takes ### pays } a lot of time on them.
She thinks it's { easy ### necessary ### difficult ### exciting } to learn math.
She falls behind her { parents ### subjects ### teachers ### classmates } and once failed the math exam.
Her father is angry { by ### for ### to ### with } her when he finds out about it.
Mr Scott gave a call to his { brother ### wife ### sister ### mother } who teaches math in another school.
He hoped she would come and teach his daughter { how ### where ### what ### why } to study math.
You must do more exercises and practice math problems again and again { after ### when ### if ### until } you master the subject.
About an hour later, Jane took the exercise book to her aunt and said, I have done the problem ten { time ### times ### ways ### minutes } .
Well done! her aunt said { nervously ### quietly ### happily ### angrily } .
Through the radio of the { bus ### train ### plane ### taxi } , they can talk and help each other.
Chang Tong has been a Beijing taxi { teacher ### worker ### driver ### doctor } for over ten years.
He said, Since joining the { school ### club ### class ### team } I feel that I have a lot of friends around me while driving.
Other members of them of the team are as { exciting ### excited ### surprised ### surprising } as Chang Tong.
One night, two men { drove ### ran ### stopped ### called } his taxi and told him to drive them to a far-away place.
Some member drivers got the { message ### letters ### books ### telephone } , and they drove close to Mao to follow his car.
At last two men got out of the car without { spending ### taking ### sending ### paying } him any money, but nothing else happened.
When I was walking down the street the other day, I happened to { notice ### look ### pick ### take } a small brown purse lying on the road .

When you smile, people think you are { funny ### strang ### crazy ### friendly } and easy to talk to.
When you look at yourself, think if you'd like to { talk ### say ### see ### look } to your smiling face or your usual face.
Of course the smiling face. Most people stay away from an { honest ### old ### angry ### exciting } face.
One easy way to start a conversation with someone is to say { anything ### something ### everything ### nothing } nice about them.
For example, you could talk about an interesting { answer ### book ### decision ### invention } to a teacher's question, good match at the ball field, pretty shirt, etc....
Doesn't it make you want to { have ### prefer ### finish ### keep } talking to that person?
They are all good questions to start a { discussion ### conversation ### meeting ### game } .
If you don't { meet ### believe ### know ### guess } who your favorite singer is, or what your hobbies are, think about it.
There's nothing that will { try ### stop ### find ### make } a conversation quicker than a shrug for an answer.
This leaves the other person { wondering ### forgetting ### hearing ### knowing } if they said something wrong.
Once a man wanted to go { on ### in ### from ### with } one side of a river to the other in a boat.
He had to take { after ### with ### about ### up } him a sheep, a wolf and a basket of vegetables.
But he could take only one of them at a time , because the boat was very { large ### big ### small ### beautiful } .
If I leave the wolf and the sheep together, the wolf may eat the sheep, he said to { oneself ### myself ### itself ### himself } .
And he { was ### is ### be ### can } able to get to the other side of the river with the sheep, the wolf, and the vegetables.

I felt { boring ### sad ### free ### tired } and had a slight headache.
I worked in a { busy ### free ### proper ### noisy } doctor's office.
It seemed I was going to be late { getting ### making ### calling ### working } home and my husband would be ready to pronounce me late once again.
But maybe { unless ### if ### though ### while } I hurried, I could still make it.
I was heading inside to { cost ### take ### pay ### spend } for my gas when I noticed an old couple at the counter.
I heard them asking the { distance ### number ### price ### way } to the nearest hospital.
It was the hospital that I had just { waited ### gone ### arrived ### left } a few minutes ago.
The young man at the counter was trying to be { careful ### thankful ### helpful ### wonderful } by explaining how to get there.
But the fact was that he was telling them a whole { wrong ### same ### special ### perfect } route.
So I walked over to the couple and said, Would you like to { lead ### take ### show ### follow } me to the hospital?
I'm going there, too, I said, which wasn't a lie since I had just { kept ### made ### taken ### fixed } up my mind to do it perfectly.
I got in my car and began to drive { back ### up ### out ### down } .
I looked back several times to be { worried ### sure ### angry ### surprised } they were right behind me.
It took us only fifteen { minutes ### hours ### days ### weeks } to get there as rush hour traffic was beginning to die down.

Mike, Mr Clarke's little son, is only nine. He { also ### never ### even ### only } likes reading books.
Mr Clarke always thinks he's too { old ### young ### clever ### able } to understand him and chooses the easiest ones to answer.
One day Mike read { everything ### nothing ### something ### anything } about the electric lights and was interested in it.
Then his father said proudly, Fathers always know { more ### most ### less ### least } than sons!
Why? Mike didn't answer and asked, { instead ### carefully ### quickly ### brightly } , Who invented the electric lights?
Looking at his son, Mr Clarke didn't know { when ### where ### which ### what } to answer!
She cooked for students and teachers to { support ### provide ### offer ### prefer } the family when I was young.
One day my mum came to { speak ### talk ### say ### tell } hello to me in primary school.

It was exciting, { so ### or ### and ### but } I was also very nervous.
I knew that lots of people would watch the show and that many famous pop { stars ### doctors ### teachers ### students } would come, too.
The fans of the pop stars were making a noise, so I had to speak { loudly ### quickly ### quietly ### happily } .
A lot of { food ### paper ### money ### medicine } has been given to Project Green Hope.
I hope more events like this will be organized to raise money for charity and I think more people should be { found ### invited ### caught ### carried } to take part in them.
He was very angry with her, and she was { either ### too ### also ### to } very angry with her husband.
After supper, Mr. Smith went upstairs and Mrs. Smith washed the dishes and { did ### made ### had ### built } some sewing.

To make the film { earlier ### later ### better ### cheaper } ,he learned the skill of fishing from a fisherman .
Pitt,caring { more ### less ### nothing ### much } about roles than money,has a special favour for the hard roles.After reading the screenplay of Legends of the Fall ,he was attracted by the leading character.
He asked for a lower { price ### pay ### money ### degree } from the shooting team and was willing to work in hard conditions in the Rocky Mountains for six months.

 always born in an ordinary family in 1964,he showed his { hope ### interest ### success ### feelings } in film at an early age .

I { said ### urged ### knew ### showed } her how to copy files from one disk to another and she thanked me.
A few days later, she asked me to help her again, because she { lost ### remembered ### reminded ### forgot } how to do it.
When I showed it to her, some students in my class { listened ### noticed ### played ### checked } and began to talk among themselves quietly .
When I showed it to her, some students in my class noticed and began to talk among themselves { quietly ### luckily ### sincerely ### angrily } .
Hey, could you help us change our grades? We'll { pay ### praise ### follow ### explain } for it.
I could not believe what I heard. I could get paid for something very { familiar ### easy ### interesting ### pleasant } .
The next day, my English teacher { challenged ### allowed ### taught ### asked } me to help him out again.
When he was not paying { money ### work ### attention ### interest } , I changed their grades from Fs to As.
I soon became very { common ### popular ### modest ### dishonest } among my friends.
Everything was going fine { until ### since ### because ### after } I was called into the headmaster's office.
I don't want to { believe ### reply ### hate ### influence } what your teacher said, but I have to.
No, I said finally. I didn't realize how { hard ### interesting ### serious ### important } my behavior had been.
I had disappointed my teacher and the headmaster. And there was no way { up ### in ### back ### down } .
I had to leave my school. That was a good { skill ### lesson ### story ### example } for me.
My name's Simon white. I'm a student .We have some { books ### clothes ### rules ### classes } at school and at home.
We can't { get ### arrive ### reach ### come } at school late.
We can't stay out late { at ### in ### by ### on } school nights.
Some students think these rules are { good ### bad ### funny ### easy } and they don't like them.
 { And ### Or ### But ### So } I don't agree with them.
I think these rules can help { we ### you ### us ### them } a lot.
If( ) we don't have them, { what ### how ### when ### where } can we do well in our studies?
For example, our teachers { let ### make ### ask ### have } us to clean our classroom every day.
If your parents let you go to bed early and you don't listen to them, you { don't ### can't ### doesn't ### mustn't } get up on time next morning.
The first two { rooms ### buildings ### floors ### groups } there were for persons requiring help in taking care of themselves.
We sang { bravely ### shyly ### madly ### beautifully } for them.
As we were { dancing ### meeting ### gathering ### singing } on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer , most of them stared at the walls or floor.
However, one lady { looked ### caught ### escaped ### hurt } my eye.
They weren't the songs that we were singing, at least they didn't { appear ### hear ### sound ### feel } like that.
As we got { louder ### nearer ### faster ### higher } with each song, she did as well.
The louder we got, the louder she got. { Because ### As ### Since ### Though } she was singing, she was also reaching out to us with her hands and body .
The louder we got, the louder she got. As she was singing, she was also { moving ### reaching ### coming ### spreading } out to us with her hands and body .
I knew that I should have gone over to her, but I thought that my { interests ### abilities ### feelings ### tasks } were to my students.
Just when I stopped feeling { afraid ### sure ### sorry ### scary } about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, showed me what the holiday season is really about.
Justin also { feared ### avoided ### helped ### noticed } the same lady.
The difference between us is that he { called ### acted ### looked ### kept } on her needs, but I didn't.
He looked this aged lady in her eyes and with his actions said, You are important, and I will take my { time ### flower ### body ### cheek } to let you know that.
No { words ### poems ### expressions ### songs } can completely describe that touching moment...
It { took ### wasted ### caused ### made } a boy to teach me, a man, about kindness and love.
It's very kind { of ### for ### at ### with } you.
I always like staying at your home in the countryside because it is so { empty ### quiet ### horrible ### serious } there.
Planes often fly right over us, so it is very { noise ### noised ### noise ### noises } sometimes.
And there is also a factory near our house, and that { make ### makes ### made ### making } a lot of noise, too.
I am sure I will have a good time there. { What ### When ### Why ### How } is Uncle John?
We were very sorry to hear about his { ill ### illness ### bad ### badness } , I have drawn a picture for him and I will bring it with me when I visit you.
It is because they have no { courage ### hobby ### time ### interest } in sports?
It may not be true. They often say they have { very ### much ### another ### most } more important things to do.
They have to get themselves ready for all kinds of exams and tests in school, so many of them almost { turn ### look ### become ### grow } bookworms.
In the past in the summer holidays, they could do { anything ### nothing ### anybody ### nobody } they like, but now they have to spend all their time preparing for exams.

It can depend { in ### on ### for ### like } the seasons, the moon or the sun.
Just before 12 o'clock, everyone { counts ### count ### counted ### counting } down from 10, 9, 8 ... As soon as it' s 12 o'clock, everyone shouts very loudly, Happy New Year!
Suddenly there { am ### is ### be ### are } fireworks and special drinks.
Sometimes people sing an old song { calls ### calling ### called ### call } Auld Lang Syne .
Some families get together for a special { meal ### breakfast ### lunch ### supper } with grandparents, aunts and uncles.
When the weather is { well ### good ### hot ### fine } , many families go out for a walk.
I will work harder at school. Or I won't spend so much time { play ### playing ### played ### plays } video games.
So it does not matter how they celebrate, for people in countries all over the world, it is a time to { say ### tell ### talk ### speak } goodbye to the old year, and to welcome the new.
And it was my first { day ### week ### term ### month } at my new school.
I was walking alone slowly and { dreaming ### caring ### talking ### worrying } about lots of things.
Suddenly a girl who was { flying ### riding ### driving ### running } a bike on ice fell down.
 { Before ### After ### Without ### From } thinking, I went over and helped her.
She said { Hello ### Pardon ### Sorry ### Thanks } with a smile and then rode away.
The teacher led me to the { classroom ### playground ### library ### office } and introduced me to the class.
I felt so { happy ### nervous ### calm ### serious } that I didn't dare to look at her.
Soon the first class, { physics ### English ### geography ### chess } , started.
As I was wondering { what ### how ### when ### where } to do, an English book appeared in front of me.
I studied hard and { became ### made ### got ### did } well in all the subjects, so the questions were not difficult for me.
 { So ### But ### Or ### And } I stopped when I read the last one : What is the hobby of the woman that cleans the school ?
 But I stopped when I read the last one : What is the { address ### number ### name ### hobby } of the woman that cleans the school ?
She had dark hair. But { where ### how ### what ### when } would I know her name?
In fact, I had never even thought { about ### over ### for ### back } talking to her.
Before the class ended, one student asked, Will the last question count toward { we ### us ### ours ### our } grade?
They deserve your attention and care, even if you just { shout ### smile ### cry ### laugh } and say hello to them.
I've { never ### ever ### already ### just } forgotten that lesson.
That was, perhaps, the most { difficult ### interesting ### important ### exciting } lesson of my life.

 { In ### At ### On ### With } the way home we had to stop at traffic lights, and there my wife saw the bookshelf.
We'll carry it home on the roof-rack . I've always wanted { it ### that ### one ### this } like that.
Ten minutes { after ### in ### late ### later } I was twenty dollars poorer, and the bookshelf was tied on to the roof-rack.
It was tall and narrow, quite heavy { too ### also ### either ### neither } .
As it was { getting ### going ### coming ### driving } darker, I drove slowly.

My wife began to laugh. Suddenly I understood { why ### because ### when ### where } the police drove here.

 Traditionally in China, teachers and parents always tell children { when ### why ### how ### what } they should and shouldn't do .
They hardly ever think { to ### in ### on ### by } themselves.
A { mother ### father ### girl ### boy } wrote to the magazine Teens about her family story.
She was very { sad ### happy ### busy ### angry } before because her father hardly played with her.
After years of thinking, she finally { advised ### discovered ### decided ### allowed } to write her father a letter, telling him about her sadness.
To her { worry ### surprise ### interest ### wish } , her father said sorry to her.
From then on, he really { changed ### wrote ### left ### played } .
Sometimes, we should { let ### do ### see ### fear } our parents hear our voices, so that they can understand our thoughts and feelings.
Are you angry with { you ### yourself ### yours ### your } if you aren't?
When a baby falls, the loving parent { obeys ### beats ### encourages ### hates } him, That's OK.
Can you imagine if after many falls, the parent picks up the baby and says, Well, I guess you'll { nearly ### always ### never ### often } be good at walking.
I do. I didn't lose my { confidence ### chance ### dream ### plan } .
When I was a kid, my dad told me, you know, I { produced ### invented ### thought ### wanted } 4 UP , but it wasn't very good.
 { Finally ### First ### Luckily ### Second } I tried 6 UP, but it didn't succeed.

The boy was so hurry { so ### and ### that ### but } he couldn't say a word except pointing towards the river.

Then they stopped a car and took the girl to the { house ### school ### park ### hospital } .
At last the girl's life was saved, and she { thanks ### thanking ### thanked ### thank } them very much.
But there is a simple and { dull ### all ### good ### close } way.
Try to talk in English { with ### and ### of ### from } your teacher and your classmates.
Don't just read the { magazines ### textbooks ### newspapers ### picture-books } that you use in the class.
Try to { know ### find ### teach ### write } something in English as much as you can, such as the things you did during the day.
These { thing ### work ### job ### things } are not hard, but they are the work that you should do .

At last he said, { Something ### Anything ### Everything ### Nothing } serious, but I'm afraid you are eating too much.
Oh! You mean I'm too { thin ### heavy ### tall ### healthy } .
The answer is easy, said the doctor, If you want to be thinner and healthier, you { must ### should ### shouldn't ### didn't } eat a lot of food and you should also do much heavy .

Yesterday I was tidying up my room. I found { a ### an ### the ### / } old box of my father's .
He gave { it ### box ### them ### its } to me two years ago .
It was really interesting to discover some of my father's childhood { pictures ### photos ### hobbies ### friendships } .
He once told me { who ### which ### that ### what } he wrote to people all over the world, and they sent him letters ,too .
He once told me that he wrote to people all over the world, { but ### so ### then ### and } they sent him letters ,too .
He once told me that he wrote to people all over the world, and they sent him { books ### letters ### boxes ### stamps } ,too .
People also gave him things from different { countries ### schools ### childhoods ### years } ,such as a silk from Japan, a little doll from England, and a small model ship from Australia.
My father even { took ### kept ### brought ### gave } he ticket from his first football match!
It made me think about looking { for ### after ### up ### down } my collection of countries pictures books and magazines .
It made me think about looking letters my collection of { new ### old ### interesting ### different } pictures books and magazines .
It was the { best ### worst ### latest ### newest } day of his life.
His { mind ### heart ### head ### brain } would not stop thinking about what happened only just an hour ago on the soccer field.
He had let his whole team down. { Its ### Their ### Our ### His } stupid mistake made him angry.
Peter's feeling were { said ### read ### spoken ### written } all over his face.
I lost the game, Peter replied. Then he went into his room { without ### except ### besides ### including } another word.
I don't know what happened. But whatever it was, don't be too { upset ### strong ### hard ### worried } on yourself.
I lost the game, Dad. I { failed ### lost ### missed ### beat } my team.
They'll { probably ### always ### hardly ### really } never let me play again.
Soccer is about team { time ### effort ### money ### energy } .
The next day, Peter went to soccer practice with { courage ### confidence ### happiness ### worries } rather than fear in his heart.
I'm really sorry about yesterday. We were so { lucky ### used ### close ### familiar } to winning that game.
But I think if we { continue ### complain ### compare ### complete } to pull together, we're going to win the next one.
We should think about { why ### how ### where ### what } we can do better next time.
They start to judge them only through their eyes, rather than their { noses ### ears ### hearts ### mouths } .
She always tells other people { quietly ### suddenly ### truly ### proudly } that she has found a lovely shirt on sale.
Unlike her, many adults { hide ### change ### prove ### discover } the fact that they buy things on sale.
 { Before ### While ### After ### Since } we had parked our car, Bill jumped out to go into the store.
Then I { believed ### noticed ### thought ### decided } that there was an old truck behind our car, with a lot of clothes on it.
Many people were standing { on ### in ### around ### under } it.
However, I found that the clothes were of bad { quality ### fashion ### memory ### habit } ; they were not very nice, and they were not even clean.
 { Worried ### Excited ### Wounded ### Surprised } , I asked Hanna, Dear, why do you like it?
It was also { old ### dirty ### cheap ### bad } , because of the rain from the day before.
 { And ### So ### But ### Or } children don't need those strange reasons.
They do { much ### many ### better ### more } for us than anyone else around you.
Some kids { love ### dislike ### like ### enjoy } their parents' strictness with them.
So how can you make things easier on yourself? It is easier { than ### what ### how ### when } you think.
Call them if you stay somewhere else { earlier ### shorter ### sooner ### later } than usual .
Everyone can make a mistake . Say { sorry ### hello ### no ### yes } to them when you are wrong.
Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about { theirs ### their ### themselves ### them } with you.
Most of all, { want ### try ### wish ### hope } to understand them.
You don't have to be the best, { so ### if ### but ### and } when you do your best, you'll make your parents proud .
It makes them { difficult ### happy ### hard ### unlucky } to see that you're turning into such a great kid.

All my money was in the bag. If I couldn't find it, I could buy { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } .
I was afraid that my parents { might ### need ### will ### should } be angry with me.
I kept thinking about how I lost my bag and { why ### when ### what ### where } my parents would say to me.

With the demands of work and family, it might feel that there's not much time { leave ### keep ### left ### stay } over for you.
Perhaps you even feel sorry about taking time for yourself - after all , shouldn't you { cost ### take ### spend ### pay } that time with your kids, or your spouse , or your parents?

Paying no attention to his { appearance ### happiness ### illness ### carelessness } , he greeted us in a friendly way.
Once inside, my daughters said in a low voice, Mom, he { smokes ### shouts ### smells ### smiles } .
We then watched other { travelers ### visitors ### passengers ### customers } come into the restaurant but many took no notice of him.
Seeing this rudeness truly { taught ### upset ### troubled ### surprised } me.
Yet sometimes being a good example was { tiring ### amazing ### difficult ### successful } , especially when things didn't go right.
Letting them in first, I said a loud thank you to { him ### them ### myself ### themselves } as I went out.

I went back and asked our waitress to { buy ### add ### show ### borrow } one soup and sandwich.

When I was 13 years old, a boy gave me an important gift. It was a { book ### help ### smile ### surprise } .
It was the early autumn of my { first ### second ### third ### last } year at a middle school, and my old school was far away.
I was very { happy ### sleepy ### lonely ### friendly } , and afraid to make friends with anyone.
I couldn't talk to anyone about my { hobbies ### worries ### favorite ### problems } , and I didn't want my parents to worry about about me.
At that moment, a boy { entered ### left ### watched ### locked } the classroom.
He passed me and then turned back. He looked at me and, { in ### with ### besides ### without } a word, smiled.
Suddenly, I { found ### saw ### felt ### knew } the touch of something bright and friendly.

I started to talk with the other students and { had ### made ### became ### were } friends.
Day by day, I became { closer ### quicker ### easier ### worse } to everyone in my class.
One day, I asked him why he smiled, but he couldn't { stop ### forget ### enjoy ### remember } smiling at me!
It doesn't matter because all the { big ### dark ### happy ### sunny } day have gone.
So smile at the world and it will { come ### smile ### turn ### give } back.

They say if { fewer ### less ### many ### more } people rode bikes to work, there would be fewer cars and less dirty air.
They want to have special roads for bikes only because when bike riders must use the same roads { as ### like ### beside ### on } cars, there may be accidents.

On Saturdays and Sundays, the largest open park in New York is { closed ### open ### opening ### closing } to cars, and the roads may be used by bikes only, but the group still says this is not enough and goes on fighting to get bike roads.
One day, while I was driving past him with my daughter, I decided to { look ### laugh ### shout ### wave } at him with a lot of excitement .
Then, I saw his { leg ### hand ### foot ### head } go up and he waved back .
I told her that it was just an act of kindness that didn't { cost ### bring ### break ### hide } anything, and it gave both him and me a sense of joy .
She responded by saying that she was a bit embarrassed to wave to a { smoker ### stranger ### manager ### driver } , but next time she would try it as well .
Lucky for us, we lived close to the old man, so we { saw ### asked ### thanked ### visited } him rather often .
Whenever we drove by, both of us would wave at him and, pretty soon, the old man { started ### succeeded ### guided ### lasted } waving at everyone who passed by his house .
One day, my daughter's friend came to visit and she told my daughter that she saw this strange old man near our home who waved at her very { slowly ### gradually ### excitedly ### safely } .She mentioned that she waved back at him, even though she didn't know him, and that it felt really good.
Her friend responded, Tell your mom that's really { different ### easy ### cool ### humorous } !
Other friends made similar comments , and this response taught my daughter just how much an act of kindness can be very natural and effortless, if you really want to do it.It showed us how giving happiness { attracted ### controlled ### reminded ### benefited } both the giver andthereceiver.
Inspired by all these positive effects, we're planning to give our elder waving neighbor a thank-you card, to express our thanks for the warmth that he communicated through his enthusiastic waves.And to thank him for { getting ### sharing ### following ### keeping } this simple joy with all who pass by his house.

After everyone had done it, I asked the group to think about how { special ### different ### strange ### same } the room looked when they changed their perspective .
Then I asked them to { miss ### consider ### like ### thank } their bosses.
Was this the same person who had seen their good { qualities ### tastes ### looks ### skills } and hired them?
Do they remember how happy they were to be { found ### refused ### chosen ### trained } for the job?
He said I looked at him and asked if he had { never ### always ### sometimes ### ever } said thank you to his boss for the opportunity to make a living.
He answered no. He told me his { life ### luck ### salary ### job } changed that night.
He went back to work with a { sorry ### post ### thank-you ### greeting } card to his boss.
This morning, however, she { met ### invited ### phoned ### shouted } nobody and heard only the sounds of animals.
When she { first ### then ### next ### finally } reached the top, she noticed a dark shape several inches from her left foot.
She was { moved ### excited ### surprised ### energetic } and then looked carefully.
It was a few seconds { after ### before ### so ### because } she realized that the dog's eyes were open.
She greeted in a soft voice to show she was { honest ### modest ### friendly ### curious } .The bull dog shook when hearing her voice.
Andi inched closer and { pulled ### dropped ### fell ### pushed } some water into the dog's mouth.
He tried to stand up but failed. { Something ### Nothing ### Anything ### Everything } was wrong with his left front leg.
Andi called her husband, Jason, but he didn't { talk ### contact ### speak ### answer } .She knew that if she didn't carry the dog down the mountain, he would die.She carefully put her arms under the dog's body.
He was so { weak ### sure ### excited ### afraid } that he fell into her chest.
 { Just ### Ever ### Still ### Even } her arms and back started aching, she didn't give up.
The trip up had taken 30 minutes { where ### when ### while ### however } going back down took twice that.
He and their son, Justin, jumped into the car and drove to pick up Andi quickly.Later that morning, an X-ray { wrote ### said ### showed ### explained } that the bull dog was badly hurt, he was likely to lose his left leg.
A few { minutes ### days ### seconds ### moments } later, the Davises returned to the animal hospital .
A few days later, the Davises returned to the animal { factory ### hospital ### farm ### family } .
A healthy body is the best riches . { With ### Without ### After ### Before } it, nothing can be done well.
If you are poor in health, you will have to take { medicine ### food ### drink ### fruit } day after day.
Everyone needs friends { if ### because ### while ### though } no one can live through life alone or do everything he wants to.
Besides the example above, patriotism is the one we should never { remember ### answer ### forget ### ask } .

This is { good ### bad ### right ### wrong } .
For many months he had admired(,) a beautiful sports car in a seller's showroom, and knowing his father could { sell ### afford ### keep ### like } it, he told him that was all he wanted.
On the morning of his graduation day his father called him into his own study and told him how { comfortable ### encouraged ### proud ### moved } he was to have such a fine son.
 { Careful ### Serious ### Nervous ### Curious } but slightly disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely book.
 { Angrily ### Happily ### Calmly ### Quietly } ,he raised his voice at his father and said, With all your money you only give me a book?
Then he rushed out of the house, { putting ### taking ### leaving ### forgetting } the book in the study.
He didn't contact his father for a whole year { until ### as ### before ### unless } one day he saw an old man who looked like his father in the street.
When he was going to leave for the hospital, he saw the new book still on the desk, just as he had left it one { year ### month ### week ### day } before.
Suddenly, a car key { lost ### came ### appeared ### dropped } from an envelope behind the book.
It had a tag .On the tag was the { met ### place ### date ### picture } of his graduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.

They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways ; that they're strict with their children ; and they { always ### seldom ### often ### usually } give their children a free hand .
It's true that parents often find it { easy ### possible ### interesting ### difficult } to get on well with their children.
In fact, they seem to forget { how ### what ### who ### where } they themselves felt when they were young.
It's one of their ways to show that they're grown up and they can { deal ### face ### do ### have } any difficulties.
Most of them plan things ahead, at least in the back of their minds, and don't like their { health ### plans ### ways ### work } to be broken by something unexpected.
Young people often { cause ### let ### think ### keep } their parents angry at their choices in clothes, in hobbies and in music.
But they don't { mean ### decide ### plan ### need } to cause any trouble.
For many years, you will be completely under your parents' { control ### pay ### look ### worry } .
If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility , they will certainly believe you, and you can do { all ### which ### that ### what } you want to do.
He liked to draw pictures and he thought these pictures { is ### are ### was ### were } good.
No one liked his pictures, { and ### so ### but ### then } they were afraid of him.
So they said he drew very { good ### well ### beautiful ### fine } .
One day he showed his { pictures ### books ### money ### cream } to an honest man, and said, How about my pictures?
To his surprise, the honest man said that they were { good ### well ### bad ### badly } in fact.
The king got { angry ### glad ### exciting ### funny } and put the honest man into prison.
When the honest man returned from { palace ### park ### station ### prison } , the king invited him to his palace to have dinner with him.
He showed him some of his new pictures again and { visited ### asked ### stopped ### taught } him what he thought of them.
The honest man said { something ### anything ### nothing ### everything } but turned back to the soldiers and said, Put me into prison!
What will you do to make sure you reach your goals? There are { two ### three ### four ### five } main steps .
First, sit down and { work ### help ### write ### sell } your dreams out.
Imagine yourself at the end of the year or maybe { in ### for ### during ### before } five years.
What do you see? { What ### Who ### Which ### How } do people see you?
What are you doing? Are you { energetic ### successful ### helpful ### unfair } ?
It's a vision of how you { see ### forget ### enjoy ### introduce } yourself in the future.
 { First ### Second ### Third ### Fourth } come the goals.
If you want to be rich, tell how much { water ### attention ### money ### knowledge } you need to be rich.
If you want { poor ### low ### bad ### good } grades, tell what you mean by 'good'.
In fact, the more specific the goal is, the { smaller ### bigger ### easier ### harder } it will be to get it.
They tell { normally ### probably ### exactly ### shortly } what you will do and when you will do it.
When you think about what you will do, don't use words like ' { wait ### try ### decide ### waste } ' or 'maybe'.
Every day or every week you can ask, 'Did I { prefer ### need ### forget ### do } this?'
In English the weather is changable. It is a { important ### common ### interesting ### difficult } subject of conversation.
I think it's going to snow. People often start a conversation { off ### by ### with ### for } these words .
But he doesn't always { ask ### tell ### speak ### say } us what we want , and sometimes he makes mistakes .
One day, all the feelings knew that the island would sink , so they prepared to { stay ### swim ### leave ### die } .
But Love decided to stay. When the island was { almost ### hardly ### already ### just } sinking, Love asked for help.
First, Love asked Richness, Can you { help ### take ### send ### drop } me with you?
Richness answered. No. There is a lot of { clothes ### rice ### grass ### gold } in my boat.
I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might make my boat { dirty ### nice ### heavy ### light } .
Oh, I am so sad that I need to be { happy ### alive ### alone ### afraid } !
Later, Happiness passed by, but she was too happy to { hear ### see ### notice ### watch } Love's voice!
It was an elder. Love felt so excited that she { remembered ### forgot ### decided ### stopped } to ask his name.
When they arrived at a { beautiful ### secret ### dangerous ### safe } place, the elder went away.
It was Time, Knowledge answered. But { when ### where ### why ### how } did Time help me?
Mr. Evans lives in a city. He was a { worker ### teacher ### doctor ### farmer } three years ago.
He taught well and his students { liked ### wished ### helped ### told } him and he decided to work in the middle school all his life.
But a bad thing { planned ### showed ### stopped ### changed } everything.
The children saw a lot of { helpful ### dangerous ### kind ### interesting } things and had a good time there.
But on their way to school, their { bus ### train ### car ### ship } hit by a truck because the young driver drank a lot.
The bus was badly damaged .Five { drivers ### teachers ### students ### girls } died and more than half of the children were badly hurt in the accident.

He didn't know how it happened and was sad and after he came out of hospital, he left the school and became a { doctor ### policeman ### teacher ### worker } .
Suddenly he saw a car running to the { crossing ### road ### stop ### bridge } .

So { almost ### never ### always ### still } everybody meets with the failure in his life.
However, different people have different { activities ### answers ### ideas ### ways } to deal with the failure.
They seem to think that it is the { area ### end ### start ### shock } of the world.
Others, on the other hand, don't take failure { seriously ### serious ### angry ### angrily } .
If we are afraid of the failure and always feel { careful ### happy ### angry ### upset } , and don't try our best to change ourselves, we may meet with more and more failures.
But as long as we are hopeful and brave to face them, and never give up, we will { become ### turn ### get ### grow } successful and our dreams will come true some day.
But if we never give up and { often ### always ### never ### Seldom } do little by little, it will make a big difference.

A boy { liked ### helped ### named ### asked } Ling got a seed, too.
He planted it { careful ### carefully ### careless ### carelessly } .
A year later, Ling had to take his { full ### empty ### beautiful ### broken } box to the palace.
Others all brought beautiful plants there and Ling felt { sad ### excited ### happy ### satisfied } .
The king smiled and said to the others, One year ago, I gave everyone a seed { which ### who ### what ### it } couldn't grow.
But all of you, { beside ### with ### except ### as } Ling, have bought me plants and flowers.
Ling was the only one with the honesty and { skill ### courage ### experience ### fear } to bring such a box.
My { name ### number ### class ### row } is Lucy Green.
I'm a { man ### woman ### girl ### boy } I'm American .
My teacher is a { boy ### man ### English ### woman } .

I have forgotten the math question my second-grade teacher, Joyce Cooper asked that day, but I will never forget my { question ### answer ### result ### reaction } .
As soon as the number left my mouth, the whole class started { talking ### shouting ### discussing ### laughing } .
Mrs. Cooper fixed them with a firm look. Then she said: We're all here to { work ### learn ### play ### watch } .
Another time, Mrs. Cooper asked us to write a { letter ### song ### report ### story } about what we hoped to do with our lives.
I wrote: I want to be a { teacher ### friend ### reporter ### parent } like Mrs. Cooper.
She wrote on my report, You would make an outstanding teacher { because ### unless ### until ### before } you are determined and you try hard.
I was to carry those { reports ### words ### teachers ### classmates } in my heart for the next 27 years.
Then one day I thought of my { plan ### work ### dream ### idea } of how I wanted to help children.
I talked it over with my family and { supposed ### promised ### decided ### agreed } to attend college classes in the mornings before work.
And when I got home from work, I would { sleep ### study ### rest ### play } .
Not long after I started { studying ### writing ### thinking ### teaching } , something happened that brought the past rushing back to me .
Not long after I started teaching , something happened that brought the { teacher ### life ### past ### feeling } rushing back to me .
Then I asked students to come and { correct ### prove ### check ### read } the mistakes.
As the other children laughed, { water ### tears ### sweat ### smiles } rolled down her face.
The boy didn't like eating { fruits ### meat ### vegetables ### rice } very much.
The more he looked at the apple, the { sadder ### angrier ### hungrier ### happier } he felt and the more he wanted it.
He began to { jump ### look ### walk ### climb } up and down, as high as he could, at the top of each jump stretching his arms to get the apple.
Still it remained out of { hope ### hand ### sight ### reach } .
Not giving up, he thought, if he had something to { put ### stand ### work ### hold } on, he could reach it.
His school bag wouldn't give enough height and he didn't want to { break ### shake ### use ### change } the things inside, like his lunch box, pencil case, and Gameboy.
Looking { down ### up ### around ### out } , he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, but he found nothing that he could use .
Looking around , he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, but he found nothing that he could { move ### take ### hold ### use } .
At first he felt angry and disappointed thinking about how hungry he had become from his { wishes ### ideas ### efforts ### troubles } , and how he really wanted that apple.
However, the boy of our story was a { smart ### kind ### brave ### careful } one, even if he couldn't always get what he wanted.
There's { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } more I can do to get the apple.
That is unchangeable. But we should try to { change ### express ### forget ### describe } our feelings.
I hadn't seen him for years and this was a good { sign ### chance ### sense ### dream } to meet him again.
I was busy at school so it was rather { strange ### cold ### late ### quiet } when I came back home.
After a hurried meal I left. { Finally ### Suddenly ### Strangely ### Luckily } I found a taxi very soon.
I was soon at the station and was sure that I would be able to { stop ### see ### catch ### miss } the train.
To my complete { satisfaction ### hope ### surprise ### joy } , when I reached the platform, I saw that the train had just left!
It was the last train so I had to { call ### leave ### reach ### return } home.
But I was unhappy. I tried to relax and went to bed but I had a { deep ### bad ### great ### heavy } sleep.
The next morning I was very tired. As I was having breakfast the { newspaper ### ticket ### mild ### train } arrived.
I read over the pages and was shocked to { find ### hear ### feel ### remember } that the train I missed had had an accident.
How { hopeful ### thankful ### careful ### painful } I was that I missed the train!

Then she thought she would like to know how much money she would get { until ### since ### if ### moreover } she picked five kilograms.

As I { went ### changed ### turned ### grew } older, I remembered my father and I listened to many basketball games on the radio.
I always fell asleep { when ### although ### because ### before } the game was over.
When I woke up in the morning, the score sheet with the { public ### final ### official ### lucky } score on it would be lying next to me.
The { smell ### color ### taste ### shape } and the warmth from the bread made me hungry and kept me warm.

I told her we had wasted so much { electricity ### water ### food ### money } .
She thought I was right and now cooks { mainly ### only ### mostly ### specially } what we can eat.
It is not { right ### fine ### bad ### necessary } to be wasteful.
I find there is a simple { way ### thing ### plan ### project } of not wasting things.
That is to use only what we { buy ### need ### bring ### get } .
Do not touch what we do not need. { On ### In ### For ### At } this way we can stop being wasteful.
