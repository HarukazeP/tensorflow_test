Yet , with all this , you made me { } what you wanted to know.
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house , with Toller { } behind us.
I heard that Barclay had married Nancy , and that he was { } rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak.
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any { } from within.
The King { } at him in amazement.
I handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and { } for some time in silence.
He carries some { } about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it.
I could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark { } I knew that it was a rich material.
He had started { } swiftly over the moor , and I had followed at his heels.
The new { } will have come , however , before the story can be safely told.
I determined to wait until I got back to town before { } my story to the police.
His face set hard , and a baleful light { } up in his grey eyes.
As it is , I feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my { } round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand.
If the former , she had probably { } the photograph to his keeping.
The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between { } of lead foil.
I had { } and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
Her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to { } an honest living.
He had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a { } which one would hardly have expected from his appearance.
He was { } by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.
My stepfather has { } no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring.
It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have { } your curiosity.
I knew that it was my { } voice.
In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the { } moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.
The proceedings against the page broke down for want of { } , and the Brook Street Mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print.
It was nearly { } between the oak and the house.
If you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for God's sake let me give you notice and leave in a { } , as if of my own free will.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other { } who has dropped into a church.
I am only , of course , giving you the leading { } now of my examination of the paper.
Therefore something had occurred between { } and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.
If I could get his { } it might save me a long and weary hunt.
I could only check it by { } if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not { } some further light upon these dark places.
It will give him the { } for which he has been seeking.
He has { } and he has knowledge.
Then , when I { } a light upon them , close in swiftly.
But we have more { } reasons than that for supposing it.
He was once a { } in the north of England.
She listened for an instant , { } up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
His dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of { } about his necktie.
The lady looked quickly up with an { } gleam in her hazel eyes.
We are but { } her from injuring another.
There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was { } off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches.
It might or might not { } the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
I measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and I { } a peg into the spot.
Neither address nor { } is attached to it.
The twilight had { } in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.
But the girl held true to me , and it seemed that I would have had her when the { } broke out , and all hell was loose in the country.
He was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the { } of his emotion.
There was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man { } that I should sit in it.
It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the { } cylinder.
Until after the { } of fire , I had not a suspicion.
He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing { } and averted eyes.
The house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty { } from the high-road.
You are to ask the questions , Mr. Melas , and he will { } the answers.
At one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the { } of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock.
He turned the two best { } of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself.
It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall , at the { } of Mr. Melas.
A young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich { } of the garden and the balmy summer air.
As I ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and { } slowly upon its hinges.
One side of the window was open , which I understand was quite usual in the { } , and he passed without difficulty into the room.
It was an old { } door and gave at once before our united strength.
And yet it would be the { } treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
He is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their { } the other night.
You have all the cleverness which makes a { } man.
His secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to { } it.
Nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to { } that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.
And into her { } , which was the very room which I suspected.
And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter , the { } of which is still involved in some mystery.
I suppose there would be no chance of a { } back.
His heart was { } , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision.
But now your thoughts went back to Beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were { } the character in his features.
But incredulity and indifference were evidently my { } cards.
And then again , sir , we were both of us very { } of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us.
As it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a { } and disappointed man.
He was off in one of those { } outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
I made no allusion to what had passed , and { } with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.
Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room , and was { } to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.
These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as { } as a gold-mine.
Then Mr. Alec ran out and { } beside the wounded man.
It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was { } by the butler and the footman.
While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer , who had acquired an { } over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him.
I ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her { } seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
For a moment or two I sat { } , hardly able to believe my ears.
He is a bit of a Don Juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very { } part to play in a quiet country district.
I will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these { } and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
He was a man of singular habits , { } company and very seldom going out.
As I gave a last { } glance around , I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.
He appeared to be { } , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent.
The woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the { } light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.
Luck had been against us again and again in this { } , but now at last it came to my aid.
I rose and examined carefully the different { } of wood which were scattered round the floor.
And yet I { } all appearance of interest.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be { } across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission.
It hadn't pulled up before she { } out of the hall door and into it.
In an instant his strange { } began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
As we walked home together , Holmes stopped at a { } office and sent off several wires.
A splendid { } with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building.
It was not until we had reached home that I began to { } the true state of affairs.
For that matter , { } , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all.
He was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an { } to cover extreme natural diffidence.
I often take advantage of the { } which it gives.
It was a delicate point , and it { } the field of my inquiry.
He has been very { } to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on.
It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London , and the { } , though frayed , were of rich quality.
No case , however , in which Holmes was engaged has ever { } the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.
But then , when I found how I had { } myself , I began to think.
I am a { } man to fall foul of.
It was worth an effort to find out , and for that { } we all went up to the house.
Then suddenly another sound became { } a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.
No sound came from within , and at the silence Holmes' face { } over.
The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the { } was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
It gave even my { } nerves a shudder to look at it.
At first he was very { } to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better.
You may then walk to the end of the street , and I will { } you in ten minutes.
It was a { } thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody.
For many years I have been the chief Greek { } in London , and my name is very well known in the hotels.
I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong { } of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.
I trust that I am not more { } than my neighbours , but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.
He had { } been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.
The inspector had { } his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them.
The cries , which had { } down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited.
I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to { } America.
I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the { } and down a winding stair.
You , of course , saw that { } in the street was an accomplice.
She left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , { } about her approaching wedding.
For God's sake , sir , I { } of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy { } in his hand.
Nor was the fact of the { } being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow.
God help those who wander into the great { } now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass.
Suddenly there was the { } gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
The Lord St. Simon marriage , and its { } termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.
We both sat in silence for some little time after { } to this extraordinary narrative.
When I had made it clear to them , I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to { } my own curiosity.
I made excellent { } , and they are only delayed one day upon their way.
But there were { } signs that I had not come upon a false scent.
The furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly { } them before her flight.
I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and { } in some sort of loose white gown.
Peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which { } from a small brass tripod in the centre.
She had been terribly { } immediately after his disappearance.
If I lay on my face the { } would come upon my spine , and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.
The garden and the stables of course have a { } staff.
Sorry to see that you've had the British { } in the house.
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was { } , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.
The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit { } about into every corner of the room.
My companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the { } , I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.
I shall call with the King { } , and with you , if you care to come with us.
I took out my { } and laid it on the corner of the table.
The air had turned { } and we withdrew into the hut for warmth.
I should like , however , to understand a little more { } what it is that you wish me to do.
The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was { } to apoplexy.
But he will never trouble { } in this country again.
I should not wish a smarter { } , Mr. Holmes ; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.
I have no reason to be { } of it.
A low moaning sound was coming from { } over our heads.
Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again I marked my { } with a peg.
I came in by train this morning , and on { } at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.
Besides , we must be { } , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the { } of a sheet of note-paper.
His life was { } , but in one respect he was regularity itself.
She married an artist named Lyons , who came { } on the moor.
The Colonel possessed a varied collection of { } brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies.
You can hardly realize , then , how { } I found it at first , and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.
The flush had { } in an instant , and a deathly face was before me.
At last she looked up with something { } and defiant in her manner.
It had been { } or torn right out from the roots.
I could , however , see that his face was { } pale and filled with horror and loathing.
His broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his { } smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
It was the same good friend whose warning I had so { } rejected.
I have only one other incident to record upon this { } and melancholy day.
Each daughter can claim an { } of 250 pounds , in case of marriage.
The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed { } behind us , and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
Of course he must { } the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.
On the table stood a { } with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar.
The photograph is in a { } behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.
He laughed very heartily , with a high , { } note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.
The carpet prevents any { } of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind.
Evidently because he saw something in it which had { } all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage.
He unwound the { } and held out his hand.
Altogether there are eight maids , the { } , the butler , two footmen , and a boy.
I simply want your { } about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear.
I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a { } , go where he might.
We were at breakfast when the Colonel's { } rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.
He had trained it , probably by the use of the { } which we saw , to return to him when summoned.
I rushed { } from the room on to the landing.
I have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and I think I'll { } them in you.
If there was one { } there might be others , so I looked round the hut in search of them.
His eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he { } on his face upon the ground.
Half a { } if you do it in twenty minutes.
It's not a very large { } , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.
She knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the { } , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.
All my { } instincts rose up against that laugh.
At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she { } at the door and looked back.
So tall was he that his hat { } brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.
These were all { } which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter.
I implored the { } to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.
I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to { } the heart of the mystery.
This must be the { } where the stranger lurked.
My friend hardly glanced up as I entered , and I , seeing that his { } must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited.
Would she not have made an { } queen.
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the { } at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
In normal cases one can place a man in his true { } with tolerable confidence.
Then I , rather imprudently , wished you { } , and started for the Temple to see my husband.
I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my { } when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.
These walls are { } , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard.
One other detail of interest was { } by Jane Stewart , the housemaid.
In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket , and { } my stick while I was chasing Teddy , who had run up the curtain.
Together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united { } would suffice to raise the stone.
Everything was { } in my favour , and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.
Throwing aside my { } , I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , I looked in.
Once or twice we drifted into talk , and I can remember that more than once he { } a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.
For myself , my term of service in India had { } me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship.
It is not a common { } among employers in this age.
But a singular { } brought us to a standstill.
There he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little { } upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill.
I think that there was { } some more tangible cause.
Holmes had { } away , but he came back in a few minutes.
Again and again I { } her , but I could never get past that point.
Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is { } by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road.
All you have to do is just to { } out your chair in the consulting-room.
As he { } from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance.
That is his { } fault , but on the whole he's a good worker.
He was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable { } and vindictiveness.
I fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and { } it.
It is a perfectly overpowering { } , and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed , and Mr. Alec was { } a pipe in his dressing-gown.
It is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a { } pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
You must not { } , come what may.
Your task is { } to that.
Some three hours or so { } we were all in the train together , bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
Your interview with the lady has cleared the { } very much.
The portly client puffed out his { } with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
It could only be a small one , or it would have been { } upon at the coroner's inquiry.
She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to { } the last trace of her crime.
The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we { } and jolted terribly.
It struck cold to our hearts , and I stood { } at Holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
Even my { } of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
The light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the { } came a reedy , quivering voice.
As to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to { } whatever expenses I may be put to , at the time which suits you best.
That frightful cry turned the blood to { } in my veins.
I have told you now the whole truth , and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not { } then the danger in which my dear friend stood.
I paid the man and { } into the church.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes { } brightly between puckered lids.
And , first of all , we must { } our positions.
All my unspoken instincts , my { } suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist.
We shall just be in time to have a little { } with him.
Besides , I knew that my { } was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up.
I have a { } of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them.
During my long and { } acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life.
I act { } from a sense of public duty.
She stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly { } me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.
His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was { } quite tense over his outstanding bones.
I've never { } a word about it yet to mortal man.
That cold , { } , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.
My heart is { } already since I have confided my trouble to you.
And your { } had been given me.
My clothes were all { } with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
The walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the { } was also thoroughly examined , with the same result.
His aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his { } character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people.
He was all right , as far as money went , but in his { } he had given her what looked like a bad florin.
The Duke , his father , was at one time { } for Foreign Affairs.
If she were ill-used , then at any risks I was { } to go back to her assistance.
My poor friend's face had suddenly { } the most dreadful expression.
More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so { } was the effect.
These are { } men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
All day today the { } poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves.
You will observe that the hour { } upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate.
He proved to be a blackguard and { } her.
My companion let down the window , and I caught a glimpse of a low , { } doorway with a lamp burning above it.
He will not even go out of his way to { } his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right.
Matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the { } mystery.
He did { } the letter.
It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly { } some traces of this mysterious individual.
Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket { } of water.
Colonel Lysander Stark { } out , and , as I followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.
It appears to be a fragment { } from a larger sheet.
It was not { } that Holmes changed his costume.
And Holmes' { } came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister German , or the morose Englishman.
The least appearance of { } struck fire out of the old autocrat.
The lash , however , was { } upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
And yet if it were on the { } , I wonder that you did not hear it also.
This press , as I have already { } , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject.
Of course , if they had been merely after { } they would at least have made some attempt to search for it.
I rose , and , making my { } , escaped from the house.
In one of these { } the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin.
There are lonely houses { } over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing.
My coffee had not yet come , and I wondered what was the cause of the { } could be.
It brought me to the very { } of the old door.
As I left the { } I happened to meet Rachel Howells , the maid.
One piece , about three feet in length , had a very marked indentation at one end , while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been { } by some considerable weight.
They inherit { } blood by direct descent , and Tudor on the distaff side.
But to my { } , when I came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen.
All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of { } years , are eligible.
Then she { } open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
Otherwise your energy and attention must be { } instead of being concentrated.
We had a small { } this morning after breakfast.
My practice had steadily { } , and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station , I got a few patients from among the officials.
It rained hard this afternoon , as you know , and my { } were the only people who called.
Now , on the other side of this { } wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.
The unknown might be lurking there , or he might be { } on the moor.
My submission { } him and led him to further confidences.
I should like , for example , to see how far the { } of the bedrooms command the front.
From north , south , east , and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had { } into the city to answer the advertisement.
Someone in the next room had { } a dark-lantern.
Having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary { } , to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon.
I should not go too far if I were to say that there was a general { } at that time that a distinguished career lay before me.
I have made a small { } of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
We laid him upon the drawing-room { } , and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife , I did what I could to relieve his pain.
Your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which { } upon the top of your books.
It will end in my being { } into the house.
You will remember that on hearing the sound of the { } she descended and returned with the other servants.
When he reached the { } I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky.
He went out again , therefore , through the window , and having { } the help of a policeman and of a medical man , he returned.
You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and { } waste of life.
I shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal { } behind those.
I put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , I try to { } how I should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances.
Everything which had been disconnected before began at once to { } its true place , and I had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events.
Now and then I { } some remark to break the monotony of the journey , but the colonel answered only in monosyllables , and the conversation soon flagged.
At first I thought that she had not { } me , but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget , 'Oh , my God.
But we have to be careful , for we have { } been deceived by wigs and once by paint.
Holmes waved away the { } , though his smile showed that it had pleased him.
A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love , however badly he may have { } her.
From within he { } a crumpled piece of paper , and old-fashioned brass key , a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it , and three rusty old disks of metal.
I should not be very much { } if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair.
I thought that she had { } , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort.
