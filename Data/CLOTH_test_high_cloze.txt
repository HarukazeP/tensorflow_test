There is one { } thing I like to mention here.
Before we begin our { } ,my family and I do not eat.
We do this { } we know how it feels to be hungry.
We all get together in the kitchen and { } the food.
We then { } the food for 30 or more people.
I like to write a special { } on the bags like God loves you .
A lot of people { } homeless people.
Not all homeless people are bad people. Some are really { } .
Many people hate them { } no good reason .

And after we arrived, he would bend over and give me a 13 { } on the face and then tell me to be a good boy.
I always felt very shy in front of so many other { } .
Then on a rainy day I { } to tell him my feeling.
When we stopped at the school gate, the { } big smile appeared on my father's face.
I { } what would happen next.

What mattered was that my daughter was learning the { } of giving, that she was thinking about others instead of herself, and that she was trying to make her friends happy.
One of the most common questions parents ask me is, How,in this competitive world,can you raise kind children My answer is to begin by being a 36 { } adult .

As the businessman looked around in the aircraft, it became obvious that many passengers were becoming a bit { } .
Lightning lit up the darkening skies, and within moments that great plane was like a { } moving around on an ocean.
One moment the airplane was { } on terrific currents of air; the next, it dropped as if it were about to crash.
The future seemed terrible and many were wondering if they would { } it through the storm.

Research has shown that two-thirds of human conversation is taken up not with discussion of the cultural or political problems of the day, not heated debates about films we've just watched or books we've just finished reading, but plain and simple { } .
Language is our greatest treasure as a species, and what do we { } do with it?
About others' behaviour and private lives, such as who's doing what with whom, who's in and who's out-and why; how to deal with difficult { } situations involving children, lovers, and colleagues.
Are we just natural { } , of both time and words?
In fact, in his latest book, Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language, the psychologist says gossip is one of these really { } issues.
Dunbar { } the traditional view that language was developed by the men at the early stage of social development in order to organize their manly hunting activities more effectively, or even to promote the exchange of poetic stories about their origins and the supernatural.
Dunbar arrived at his cheery theory by studying the { } of the higher primates like monkeys.
By means of grooming--cleaning the fur by brushing it, monkeys form groups with other individuals on whom they can rely for support in the event of some kind of conflict within the group or { } from outside it.
As we human beings evolve from a particular branch of the primate family, Dunbar { } that at one time in our history we did much the same.
Grouping together made sense because the bigger the group, the greater the { } it provided; on the other hand, the bigger the group, the greater the stresses of living close to others.
Grooming helped to { } the pressure and calm everybody down.
But as the groups got bigger and bigger, the amount of time spent in grooming activities also had to be { } to maintain its effectiveness.
Clearly, a more { } kind of grooming was needed, and thus language evolved as a kind of vocal grooming which allowed humans to develop relationship with ever-larger groups by exchanging information over a wider network of individuals than would be possible by one-to-one physical contact .

But as I built strength, my friends { } me to step up my training and try some longer trips, The first one to come along was a 150-mile trip, the MS-150, an annual event that raises money to fight AIDS .
But as I built strength, my friends encouraged me to step up my training and try some longer trips, The first one to come along was a 150-mile trip, the MS-150, an annual { } that raises money to fight AIDS .
When I registered,the idea seemed fantastic and I trained with { } .
However,as the time for the ride approached,my selfdoubts { } beyond my endurance .
I { } wanted to raise money for the charity,but I didn't really want to bike all those miles for two days straight .
The ride began on a beautiful Sunday morning in the Georgia countryside,and for the first few hours I felt { } .
This was just the experience I had { } ,and my spirits were high .
 { } by the end of the day,I felt tired out.
If the body is { } to the mind,here was evidence.
Every { } my brain pushed out seemed to travel right down to my legs.
I can't handle this became a leg cramp ,and Everyone else is a better rider translated into { } of breath.
I was sure I'd have to { } .
Then in the distance,I saw a lone woman riding very slowly { } the bright red sun.
I { } that the person looked different in some way,but I couldn't tell why.
So I pushed myself to catch up .There she was,riding along slowly but { } ,with a slight and determined smile on her face and she had only one leg.
My focus changed in that instant. For a whole day I'd been { } my body.
But now I knew it wasn't the body,but the { } that would help me reach my goal.
I never saw the one-legged biker again,but I pushed on without { } ,knowing she was out there with me somewhere.
And at the end of the day,still feeling { } ,I completed the 150mile trip.

I've { } these, he said, handing me a bag.
She would have wanted you to { } them.
I opened the bag to find dozens of { } , each one wrapped in white tissue paper and bearing Mom's handwritten words: Stone Harbor, N.J.--8-98.
They were pretty { } , but to Mom, they were evidence of her endlessly magical life.
She was 61 when she collected these shells, already showing { } of the lung disease that would kill her the next year.
We just knew something was { } and Mom needed an adventure.
She { } dinner and a movie.
However, two friends and I had { } ideas.
We wanted to take her to Jersey Shore, { } my working-class mother had been to the ocean only twice.
She loved the { } .
When I called Mom with our { } , she was sitting on the couch with her dog Amber on her leg.
When I told her she'd be able to hear the { } from her window, she started to cry.
As soon as we got to Stone Harbor, Mom acted like the town mayor , { } everyone as if they were loyal constituents .
The morning we { } , I found her photographing every inch of her bedroom.
I don't even want to { } this, she said.
Last month, I { } them.
One by one, the shells are finding a { } place in my home.
I put them where I'm { } to see them.
They { } me to live a life like my mother--who never lost her sense of wonder.
As I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I { } a little boy, around one and a half to two years old, running freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance .
As I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I saw a little boy, around one and a half to two years old, { } freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance .
The boy would then fall to the grass, get up, and without { } or without looking back at his mother, run as fast as he could, again, still with a smile on his face.
It seemed { } had happened!
For kids, { } at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a nothing ; instead, they treat it as a learning experience .
For kids, hesitation at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a { } ; instead, they treat it as a learning experience .
The answer must be that they have not { } falling down with the word failure yet, thus they don' t know how to feel the state which accomparues failure.
Therefore, they are not { } in any way.
Touched as I was by the boy's { } , I was equally touched by the manner in which he ran.
With each attempt, he looked so { } and natural.
No { } of fear and nervousness.
His only aim was to run freely and to do it as { } as he could.
He was not looking for { } or was not worrying about whether someone was confident or not .
He was not looking for persistence or was not worrying about whether someone was { } or not .
He didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that maybe someone would see him fall ( as there were others in the park apart from him and his mother) and that it would be { } if he did fall.
No, all that { } to him was to accomplish the task or activity at hand to the best of his ability.
I { } a lot from that observation and experience, and have successfully brought that lesson with me in my many pursuits in life.

As in all of my races,I didn't { } out in the front,I loved the pleasure of passing people as my strength overtook their premature speed.
Neck and neck with one of my greatest competitors, I { } see the finish line.
I had begun the final dash into { } when my knees became weak and my legs gave way.
Nothing I could do would make them { } weight.
 { } I knew my dreams of victory were destroyed.

Voices, both { } and familiar, cheered me on.

The policeman became { } with anger.
You think you're very { } , don't you?
But tell me, if you were running { } for your health why didn't you stop when you saw me running after you?

It was { } of me, said the man, but I thought you too had been ordered to run by your doctor.

The students, { } , got started on the inexplicable task.
At the end of the class, the professor { } all the answer papers and started reading each of them aloud in front of all the students.
All of them, with no { } , described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc.
After all had been { } , the classroom was silent, and the professor began to explain: I'm not going to grade this.
I { } wanted to give you something to think about.
No one wrote about the { } part of the paper.

The professor was very { } in class.
He just looked at his lecture notes and { } looked up at us.
I felt that I needed to get rid of my boredom, so I created a little { } for myself.
I tried to find something from his lecture to ask a question about, forcing me to { } rather than letting my eyes close.

After the examination, I { } what I should have done.

Everyone in my class had grown up together, and they had no room to { } for a newcomer.
I { } for the first few weeks of school.
I had no friends, no activities, and no { } of a bright future.
To deal with it all, I began { } in my diary every day---stories of adventure, of old friends, of feelings that I could not speak.
I wrote as if my life depended on it, as if the very next breath I took could not happen { } I wrote down words.
I told her I enjoyed writing and { } writing to playing.
I was { } that I could now participate in something I knew I excelled in.
That night I worked and worked on the essay. I wrote with great { } .
It was my one chance to feel important and { } by the class.
A few days after we handed in our assignments, Mrs. Bush called me up to the { } of the classroom.
I stood before thirty pairs of eyes looking at me, and I got { } .
Then Mrs. Bush told the class how much she { } all the work that went into the essay and everyone had done a great job.
But, she said, one student stood { } as an excellent writer, one with imagination, creativity, and word mastery.
The class clapped politely and Mrs. Bush handed me my paper, with the following { } on it: Malinda, you are an excellent writer.
Please keep on writing and share your { } of writing with the world.
Mrs. Bush helped me feel a sense of { } , a place of purpose, and a way to survive a transition in life.
She helped me gain { } in myself that stayed with me beyond sixth grade.
I { } her terribly.

She didn't live in a fancy house or have { } things, but I never cared.
Although she didn't have much, { } did we, she did something for my brother Tommie and me.
I will always remember she saved her { } in a glass jar, which had belonged to her since she was married.
I am sure Granny could have { } those pennies herself but she saved them to expensive us when we came to visit .
I am sure Granny could have heart those pennies herself but she saved them to { } us when we came to visit .
Because I was the older, I was in charge of dividing the pennies { } between my brother and me.
One for you, one for me, I would { } the words until the jar was empty.
I don't remember how much we collected on our { } and the amount wasn't important at all.
It was the idea that she remembered us and cared about us { } moved me.
Those { } of my childhood still give me warm feelings when I'm sad.
I often wonder if I found a penny { } on the ground somewhere, could it possibly be Granny tossing me pennies from heaven?
It's not because I'm { } or that I don't care if my kids have a good party.

But her { } taught me an important lesson: I'm not a failure as a mom.
