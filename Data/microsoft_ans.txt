It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged { daintily } in every nook and corner.
As I descended , my old ally , the { guard } , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
We got off , { paid } our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
He held in his hand a { sheet } of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures.
Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his { stick } two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked.
There is no { communication } between them , but they all open out into the same corridor.
He and I seemed to be the only living things between the { huge } arch of the sky and the desert beneath it.
It may prove the simplest matter in the world , but all the same at first glance this is just a little { curious } , is it not.
Twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting { silently } for whatever might befall.
She never said a word until we were at the door here , when she took me by the hand and { begged } me to tell no one what had happened.
A few faint { stars } were gleaming in a violet sky.
I tell you that he is a { clever } and dangerous man.
I can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three { chimes } from a neighboring clock.
My friend was an enthusiastic { musician } , being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.
I should like to have his { opinion } of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done.
He shook hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was { anxious } to hear his story.
A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he { sprang } to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
I went up to the house with the { Inspector } , and saw all that was to be seen.
I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary { watcher } , and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs.
It swelled up louder and louder , a { hoarse } yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.
Whatever his crimes , he has { suffered } something to atone for them.
You can imagine my { exultation } , Watson , when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground.
The butler brought me my { coffee } into the library , and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.
The maid had loved the { butler } , but had afterwards had cause to hate him.
He hammered loudly at the { knocker } and pulled at the bell , but without any success.
It was several miles off , but I could { distinctly } see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray.
This , of course , fitted in well enough with the { police } theory , if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him.
The chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as I { stepped } across it told me of its richness.
The J. P shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own { chamber } , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room.
I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a { formidable } man a man who might play a deep game.
Besides , I can read in a man's eye when it is his own { skin } that he is frightened for.
The boards round and the { panelling } of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.
Miss Hunter screamed and { shrunk } against the wall at the sight of him , but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
This second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by { servants } , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.

As we ran towards it the vague outline { hardened } into a definite shape.
Holmes pulled a large sheet of { tissue-paper } out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee.
Then I carefully { paced } off five to the east and two to the south.
The instant that we heard it , Holmes { sprang } from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
He lay back without { wincing } , though he bit his lip from time to time.
I went at once to my room and drew up my { report } of the morning's conversation for Holmes.
Having once made up my mind , you know the { steps } which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.
I shall give directions that you may { remain } behind when the others go , so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked.
It may be that the solution of the one may { prove } to be the solution of the other.
They say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the { sleepers } from their beds.
Fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have { drawn } the gossips away from this four-year-old drama.
Again and again I have taken a problem to him , and have received an { explanation } which has afterwards proved to be the correct one.
There he is , all { safe } and sound.
He actually sat { crying } in an arm-chair , and I could hardly get him to speak coherently.
My mistress told me that you were { likely } to call.
It was one of the main arteries which { conveyed } the traffic of the City to the north and west.
I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the { blame } upon myself.
He had a very dark , { fearsome } face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams.
The fat man { cast } his eyes round , and then up at the open skylight.
We passed up the stair , { unlocked } the door , followed on down a passage , and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.
Holmes was for the moment as { startled } as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.
The chimney is wide , but is { barred } up by four large staples.
My companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat { pulled } down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought.
He used to make { merry } over the cleverness of women , but I have not heard him do it of late.
I have { determined } , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.
As I passed out through the wicket gate , however , I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the { shadow } upon the other side.
A low { moan } had fallen upon our ears.
I realized it as I { drove } back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.
You must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we { provide } this table and chair.
I hope to { heaven } that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here.
It threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the { shadows } beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall.
Perhaps our { visit } now may do something to make it less obscure.
That was bad enough , for all that the { coroner } said.
He had heard nothing , and the { affair } remained a complete mystery.
Then he { vanished } over the hill.
Not a { whisper } , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped.
I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law , and that there is a man here who does not fear to { invoke } it.
I sat down upon a { keg } in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over.
The inspector hurried away on the instant to make { inquiries } about the page , while Holmes and I returned to Baker Street for breakfast.
She could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what { indirect } or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
When his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as { formidable } as that with which we had started.
The back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the { stairs } he saw two men wrestling together outside.

I do not think that I have ever seen so { thin } a man.
It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust , and damp and worms had eaten through the wood , so that a crop of livid fungi was { growing } on the inside of it.

I have tried to { reconstruct } it from the measurements.
I am sorry to have { interrupted } you.
At the end were the { signatures } of the high dignitaries who had signed it.
My companion noiselessly { closed } the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room.
The darkness was { rising } , but much was still hidden by the shadows.
I was pained at the { mistake } , for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind.
We had come out upon Oxford Street and I had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to Kensington , when my words were { arrested } by the extraordinary conduct of my companion.
When I thought of the heavy { rains } and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode.
When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to { assure } him that she would be back before very long.

A collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be { incomplete } which contained no account of this very singular business.
His hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and { puckered } like a withered apple.
The point is a simple one , but the Inspector had { overlooked } it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter.
He went over to the door , and turning the { lock } he examined it in his methodical way.

Another day two at the most and I have my case { complete } , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child.
Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton , and , { cautioning } me not to speak , he led the way into the hall.

Four or five minutes afterwards the { sitting-room } window will open.
I rushed out , { calling } loudly for my stepfather , and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.
The coachman saw him { cross } the hall and enter it.
He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft { cloth } cap which he had laid down upon my books.
More than one person { fainted } at the mere sight of him , so terrible was the effect.
The smarting of it { recalled } in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure , and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.

To do this was quite beyond my power , and I could only hope that by { economy } I might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate.
Presently he emerged , looking even more { flurried } than before.
He took a small piece of torn paper from a { note-book } and spread it out upon his knee.

This girl had been { devoted } to him.
Between ourselves , I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his { illness } yet.

Then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a { crushing } weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul.
It looked as if the pair might take an { immediate } departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.
The bell-rope hangs from the { wire } just to the right of my desk.
He broke the seal and { glanced } over the contents.
Whatever she may have deserved one could not { allow } her to go hopelessly to the bad.
Before entering , Holmes made an { examination } of the door which had been forced.
Suddenly , however , as I ran , a { deadly } dizziness and sickness came over me.
As to the photograph , your { client } may rest in peace.
Look at this { stranger } hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting.
The lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was { removed } to her room , still in a state of insensibility.
It must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was { breaking } when I came to myself.
What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to { lurk } in such a place at such a time.
If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving { blanks } for the other to fill up.
He sat at my side in silence all the time , and I was aware , more than once when I { glanced } in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity.
Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a { consultation } was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room.
A maid { rushed } across and threw open the window.
At Waterloo we were fortunate in { catching } a train for Leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes.
When I went upstairs with him he pointed to several { footprints } upon the light carpet.
Here we { dismissed } our cab , and made our way up the drive together.
Then suddenly he plunged forward , { wrung } my hand , and congratulated me warmly on my success.
But here an unexpected and singular { difficulty } presented itself.
Both cases { decided } , Dr. Watson , and both in my favour.
Besides , remember that she had { resolved } to use it within a few days.
I am sure that if you { mentioned } my name they would be happy to show it to you.
Suddenly , however , he started , { tapped } me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows.
She then called for Miss Morrison , a young lady who lives in the next { villa } , and the two went off together to their meeting.
We are at present , Doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the City branch of one of the { principal } London banks.
There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was { paid } for it.
Yet , with all this , you made me { reveal } what you wanted to know.
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house , with Toller { hurrying } behind us.
I heard that Barclay had married Nancy , and that he was { rising } rapidly in the regiment , but even that did not make me speak.
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any { reply } from within.
The King { stared } at him in amazement.
I handed him my pouch , and he seated himself opposite to me and { smoked } for some time in silence.
He carries some { creature } about with him in that box ; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation , for she had never seen an animal like it.
I could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark { dress } I knew that it was a rich material.
He had started { running } swiftly over the moor , and I had followed at his heels.
The new { century } will have come , however , before the story can be safely told.
I determined to wait until I got back to town before { telling } my story to the police.
His face set hard , and a baleful light { sprang } up in his grey eyes.
As it is , I feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my { wrist } round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand.
If the former , she had probably { transferred } the photograph to his keeping.
The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between { layers } of lead foil.
I had { stooped } and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
Her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to { earn } an honest living.
He had his hand under the other's arm as they entered , and helped him to a chair with a { tenderness } which one would hardly have expected from his appearance.
He was { accompanied } by a little elderly gentleman , who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.
My stepfather has { offered } no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring.
It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have { aroused } your curiosity.
I knew that it was my { sister's } voice.
In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the { sodden } moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.
The proceedings against the page broke down for want of { evidence } , and the Brook Street Mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print.
It was nearly { midway } between the oak and the house.
If you cannot keep me after what has passed , then for God's sake let me give you notice and leave in a { month } , as if of my own free will.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other { idler } who has dropped into a church.
I am only , of course , giving you the leading { results } now of my examination of the paper.
Therefore something had occurred between { seven-thirty } and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.
If I could get his { knowledge } it might save me a long and weary hunt.
I could only check it by { finding } if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not { throw } some further light upon these dark places.
It will give him the { clue } for which he has been seeking.
He has { nerve } and he has knowledge.
Then , when I { flash } a light upon them , close in swiftly.
But we have more { assured } reasons than that for supposing it.
He was once a { schoolmaster } in the north of England.
She listened for an instant , { threw } up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
His dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat , dark trousers , and a touch of { color } about his necktie.
The lady looked quickly up with an { angry } gleam in her hazel eyes.
We are but { preventing } her from injuring another.
There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was { peeling } off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches.
It might or might not { bite } the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
I measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and I { thrust } a peg into the spot.
Neither address nor { date } is attached to it.
The twilight had { closed } in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.
But the girl held true to me , and it seemed that I would have had her when the { Mutiny } broke out , and all hell was loose in the country.
He was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the { intensity } of his emotion.
There was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man { motioned } that I should sit in it.
It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the { leaking } cylinder.
Until after the { alarm } of fire , I had not a suspicion.
He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing { answers } and averted eyes.
The house stands in its own grounds , but the west side of it is not more than thirty { yards } from the high-road.
You are to ask the questions , Mr. Melas , and he will { write } the answers.
At one side of this was a squat , brass-bound wooden box , the { lid } of which was hinged upwards , with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock.
He turned the two best { rooms } of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself.
It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall , at the { rooms } of Mr. Melas.
A young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich { scent } of the garden and the balmy summer air.
As I ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and { revolved } slowly upon its hinges.
One side of the window was open , which I understand was quite usual in the { summer-time } , and he passed without difficulty into the room.
It was an old { rickety } door and gave at once before our united strength.
And yet it would be the { blackest } treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
He is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their { experience } the other night.
You have all the cleverness which makes a { successful } man.
His secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to { divulge } it.
Nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to { prove } that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.
And into her { sitting-room } , which was the very room which I suspected.
And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter , the { explanation } of which is still involved in some mystery.
I suppose there would be no chance of a { train } back.
His heart was { weak } , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision.
But now your thoughts went back to Beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were { studying } the character in his features.
But incredulity and indifference were evidently my { strongest } cards.
And then again , sir , we were both of us very { fond } of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us.
As it was , he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a { morose } and disappointed man.
He was off in one of those { hysterical } outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
I made no allusion to what had passed , and { waited } with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.
Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room , and was { relieved } to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.
These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as { valuable } as a gold-mine.
Then Mr. Alec ran out and { knelt } beside the wounded man.
It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was { ejected } by the butler and the footman.
While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer , who had acquired an { ascendancy } over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him.
I ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her { knees } seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
For a moment or two I sat { breathless } , hardly able to believe my ears.
He is a bit of a Don Juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very { difficult } part to play in a quiet country district.
I will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these { papers } and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
He was a man of singular habits , { shunning } company and very seldom going out.
As I gave a last { hurried } glance around , I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.
He appeared to be { deformed } , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent.
The woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the { yellow } light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.
Luck had been against us again and again in this { inquiry } , but now at last it came to my aid.
I rose and examined carefully the different { billets } of wood which were scattered round the floor.
And yet I { suppressed } all appearance of interest.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be { built } across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission.
It hadn't pulled up before she { shot } out of the hall door and into it.
In an instant his strange { headgear } began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
As we walked home together , Holmes stopped at a { telegraph } office and sent off several wires.
A splendid { park } with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building.
It was not until we had reached home that I began to { realize } the true state of affairs.
For that matter , { Reading } , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all.
He was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an { attempt } to cover extreme natural diffidence.
I often take advantage of the { freedom } which it gives.
It was a delicate point , and it { widened } the field of my inquiry.
He has been very { attentive } to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on.
It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London , and the { fittings } , though frayed , were of rich quality.
No case , however , in which Holmes was engaged has ever { illustrated } the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.
But then , when I found how I had { betrayed } myself , I began to think.
I am a { dangerous } man to fall foul of.
It was worth an effort to find out , and for that { object } we all went up to the house.
Then suddenly another sound became { audible } a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.
No sound came from within , and at the silence Holmes' face { clouded } over.
The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the { lamp } was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
It gave even my { hardened } nerves a shudder to look at it.
At first he was very { eager } to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better.
You may then walk to the end of the street , and I will { rejoin } you in ten minutes.
It was a { serious } thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody.
For many years I have been the chief Greek { interpreter } in London , and my name is very well known in the hotels.
I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong { sign } of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.
I trust that I am not more { dense } than my neighbours , but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.
He had { evidently } been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.
The inspector had { lit } his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them.
The cries , which had { sunk } down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited.
I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to { South } America.
I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the { corridor } and down a winding stair.
You , of course , saw that { everyone } in the street was an accomplice.
She left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , { chatting } about her approaching wedding.
For God's sake , sir , I { beg } of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy { stick } in his hand.
Nor was the fact of the { wound } being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow.
God help those who wander into the great { mire } now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass.
Suddenly there was the { momentary } gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
The Lord St. Simon marriage , and its { curious } termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.
We both sat in silence for some little time after { listening } to this extraordinary narrative.
When I had made it clear to them , I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to { satisfy } my own curiosity.
I made excellent { arrangements } , and they are only delayed one day upon their way.
But there were { ample } signs that I had not come upon a false scent.
The furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly { ransacked } them before her flight.
I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and { clad } in some sort of loose white gown.
Peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which { flickered } from a small brass tripod in the centre.
She had been terribly { excited } immediately after his disappearance.
If I lay on my face the { weight } would come upon my spine , and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.
The garden and the stables of course have a { separate } staff.
Sorry to see that you've had the British { workman } in the house.
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was { extinguished } , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.
The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit { rolled } about into every corner of the room.
My companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the { weapon } , I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.
I shall call with the King { to-morrow } , and with you , if you care to come with us.
I took out my { revolver } and laid it on the corner of the table.
The air had turned { chill } and we withdrew into the hut for warmth.
I should like , however , to understand a little more { clearly } what it is that you wish me to do.
The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was { due } to apoplexy.
But he will never trouble { anyone } in this country again.
I should not wish a smarter { assistant } , Mr. Holmes ; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.
I have no reason to be { ashamed } of it.
A low moaning sound was coming from { somewhere } over our heads.
Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again I marked my { spot } with a peg.
I came in by train this morning , and on { inquiring } at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.
Besides , we must be { prompt } , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the { size } of a sheet of note-paper.
His life was { irregular } , but in one respect he was regularity itself.
She married an artist named Lyons , who came { sketching } on the moor.
The Colonel possessed a varied collection of { weapons } brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies.
You can hardly realize , then , how { difficult } I found it at first , and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.
The flush had { faded } in an instant , and a deathly face was before me.
At last she looked up with something { reckless } and defiant in her manner.
It had been { hacked } or torn right out from the roots.
I could , however , see that his face was { deadly } pale and filled with horror and loathing.
His broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his { sympathetic } smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
It was the same good friend whose warning I had so { foolishly } rejected.
I have only one other incident to record upon this { tempestuous } and melancholy day.
Each daughter can claim an { income } of 250 pounds , in case of marriage.
The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed { heavily } behind us , and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
Of course he must { recall } the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.
On the table stood a { dark-lantern } with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar.
The photograph is in a { recess } behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.
He laughed very heartily , with a high , { ringing } note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.
The carpet prevents any { possibility } of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind.
Evidently because he saw something in it which had { escaped } all those generations of country squires , and from which he expected some personal advantage.
He unwound the { handkerchief } and held out his hand.
Altogether there are eight maids , the { cook } , the butler , two footmen , and a boy.
I simply want your { opinion } about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear.
I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a { burr } , go where he might.
We were at breakfast when the Colonel's { butler } rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.
He had trained it , probably by the use of the { milk } which we saw , to return to him when summoned.
I rushed { madly } from the room on to the landing.
I have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and I think I'll { sink } them in you.
If there was one { report } there might be others , so I looked round the hut in search of them.
His eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he { dropped } on his face upon the ground.
Half a { guinea } if you do it in twenty minutes.
It's not a very large { affair } , and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.
She knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the { handle } , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.
All my { medical } instincts rose up against that laugh.
At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me , but she { paused } at the door and looked back.
So tall was he that his hat { actually } brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.
These were all { factors } which had to be taken into consideration , and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter.
I implored the { colonel } to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.
I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to { reach } the heart of the mystery.
This must be the { burrow } where the stranger lurked.
My friend hardly glanced up as I entered , and I , seeing that his { investigation } must be of importance , seated myself in an arm-chair and waited.
Would she not have made an { admirable } queen.
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the { music } at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
In normal cases one can place a man in his true { decade } with tolerable confidence.
Then I , rather imprudently , wished you { good-night } , and started for the Temple to see my husband.
I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my { pipe } when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.
These walls are { thick } , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard.
One other detail of interest was { remembered } by Jane Stewart , the housemaid.
In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket , and { dropped } my stick while I was chasing Teddy , who had run up the curtain.
Together they would come at night to the cellar , and their united { force } would suffice to raise the stone.
Everything was { working } in my favour , and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.
Throwing aside my { cigarette } , I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , I looked in.
Once or twice we drifted into talk , and I can remember that more than once he { expressed } a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.
For myself , my term of service in India had { trained } me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship.
It is not a common { experience } among employers in this age.
But a singular { interruption } brought us to a standstill.
There he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little { bundle } upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill.
I think that there was { probably } some more tangible cause.
Holmes had { slipped } away , but he came back in a few minutes.
Again and again I { cross-questioned } her , but I could never get past that point.
Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate , which is { separated } by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road.
All you have to do is just to { wear } out your chair in the consulting-room.
As he { dangled } from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance.
That is his { main } fault , but on the whole he's a good worker.
He was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable { violence } and vindictiveness.
I fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and { measured } it.
It is a perfectly overpowering { impulse } , and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed , and Mr. Alec was { smoking } a pipe in his dressing-gown.
It is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a { mere } pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
You must not { interfere } , come what may.
Your task is { confined } to that.
Some three hours or so { afterwards } we were all in the train together , bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
Your interview with the lady has cleared the { situation } very much.
The portly client puffed out his { chest } with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
It could only be a small one , or it would have been { remarked } upon at the coroner's inquiry.
She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to { remove } the last trace of her crime.
The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we { lurched } and jolted terribly.
It struck cold to our hearts , and I stood { gazing } at Holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
Even my { dread } of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
The light at the top was suddenly whisked out , and from the { darkness } came a reedy , quivering voice.
As to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to { defray } whatever expenses I may be put to , at the time which suits you best.
That frightful cry turned the blood to { ice } in my veins.
I have told you now the whole truth , and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not { realize } then the danger in which my dear friend stood.
I paid the man and { hurried } into the church.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over , with his eyes { shining } brightly between puckered lids.
And , first of all , we must { choose } our positions.
All my unspoken instincts , my { vague } suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist.
We shall just be in time to have a little { breakfast } with him.
Besides , I knew that my { assistant } was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up.
I have a { copy } of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them.
During my long and { intimate } acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life.
I act { entirely } from a sense of public duty.
She stared at us with defiant eyes , and then , suddenly { recognizing } me , an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.
His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was { drawn } quite tense over his outstanding bones.
I've never { breathed } a word about it yet to mortal man.
That cold , { incisive } , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.
My heart is { lightened } already since I have confided my trouble to you.
And your { address } had been given me.
My clothes were all { sodden } with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
The walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the { flooring } was also thoroughly examined , with the same result.
His aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his { unemotional } character , but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people.
He was all right , as far as money went , but in his { deposit } he had given her what looked like a bad florin.
The Duke , his father , was at one time { Secretary } for Foreign Affairs.
If she were ill-used , then at any risks I was { determined } to go back to her assistance.
My poor friend's face had suddenly { assumed } the most dreadful expression.
More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him , so { terrible } was the effect.
These are { daring } men , and though we shall take them at a disadvantage , they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
All day today the { rain } poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves.
You will observe that the hour { mentioned } upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate.
He proved to be a blackguard and { deserted } her.
My companion let down the window , and I caught a glimpse of a low , { arched } doorway with a lamp burning above it.
He will not even go out of his way to { verify } his own solutions , and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right.
Matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the { original } mystery.
He did { burn } the letter.
It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly { reveal } some traces of this mysterious individual.
Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket { half-full } of water.
Colonel Lysander Stark { sprang } out , and , as I followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.
It appears to be a fragment { torn } from a larger sheet.
It was not { merely } that Holmes changed his costume.
And Holmes' { fears } came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister German , or the morose Englishman.
The least appearance of { opposition } struck fire out of the old autocrat.
The lash , however , was { curled } upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
And yet if it were on the { lawn } , I wonder that you did not hear it also.
This press , as I have already { explained } , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject.
Of course , if they had been merely after { plunder } they would at least have made some attempt to search for it.
I rose , and , making my { excuses } , escaped from the house.
In one of these { wings } the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin.
There are lonely houses { scattered } over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing.
