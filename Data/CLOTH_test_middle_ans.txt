Music has always been a great love of mine and, in my 20s, when my sickness was more manageable , I { enjoyed } ten years as a professional singer in restaurants, playing and singing folk songs .
 { Unfortunately } that was years ago and times have changed.
 { Now } I live with mother on a country farm.
 { As } I needed to sleep in the afternoons, I was limited in my choices.
My family are all musicians, so I was { recognized } when I went into our local music store.
I knew that discs were very expensive and I really didn't have a lot of { money } to get started.
And often you find only three to four songs out of ten on a disc that you can { actually } use.
When I told the owner of the shop about my { idea } ; he gave me a long thoughtful actually .
When I told the owner of the shop about my money ; he gave me a long thoughtful { look } .
He led me { through } the crowded shop and to a bench with a large professional karaoke box on it.
He placed his large hand { lovingly } on his treasure and said, I have 800 karaoke songs in here.
His { kindness } still warms my heart and makes me do just that bit extra, when I have the chance.
Yesterday afternoon Misty and I were sitting on the grass { while } the girls were playing at the park.
We saw a(an) { elderly } man pushing a shopping cart and struggling with each step he took.

I walked over to him and asked him if he knew { where } he was.
He said that he didn't know. I asked his { name } , and he told me his name was Ray.
At this point, I walked over to Misty and told her what the { conversation } was about and she called the police to let them know the situation.
I walked back over to him and offered him { something } to drink.
He agreed and as soon as he started to walk { without } the support of the shopping cart, he was very unsteady on his feet.
I was so happy that God { offered } us the chance to do just what he would have done--the right thing and the loving thing.
I had to walk home since all the { traffic } had stopped after the quake.
On my way home I { noticed } an old Japanese lady at the bakery shop who was giving out free bread, which made my heart warm .

A middle-aged Japanese man was holding a sign that said, Please use our { toilet } .
He stood in the cold with a sign If you are okay with a motorcycle, I will { drive } you to your house.
Then the next day I drove to { fill } my car with gas.
There is a lack gas now and many gasoline stations were either closed or had very { long } lines.
Finally, when it was my { turn } , the man smiled and said, Because of this situation, we are only giving $ 30 worth gas per person.
Is that alright? Of course, I'm just glad that we are all able to { share } , I said.
I saw a man at the evacuation center { crying } when people brought food to him, It was the first time in three days that food has been brought to their center.
However, after he wiped the tears, his next { words } surprised me.
I am very { grateful } that we are provided with food.
But people in the city next to us haven't { received } any food at all.
And when hearing that, I realized there is a bright future on the other side of this { disaster } .
He { came } back last week.
He came to { visit } me yesterday and gave me a nice hat.
He said he had a great { time } in New York.
He and his parents visited many { interesting } places and went shopping there.

Lin Tao and Jimmy talked { in } English and Chinese.
Lin Tao had dinner with Jimmy's family. They took many photos with a { camera } .
I saw a young homeless man { asking } people for money so he could buy breakfast.

I couldn't hear what the young man said but watched after the old man pulled several bills from her wallet and { put } them in the young man's hands .
What I do know is that I saw two completely different reactions to the same { situation } .

A young boy ran up to me, out of { breath } .
He stood right before me with his head down and said { excitedly } , Look what I found!
In his hand was a flower, and what a poor sight! The flower was dry and { dead } .

So I accepted the flower, and replied, This is just what I { want } .
Just then, for the first time I noticed that the boy could not { see } --he was blind.
Tears came down my face as I { thanked } him for picking the best one.
You're welcome. he smiled, and then ran off to { play } .
And for all those years I myself had been { blind } .
I decided to see the beauty in life, and { enjoy } every second of my life.
About 20minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the { bathroom } .
So I took a stack of cards and a pencil and wrote, If you don't want to { talk } , we can write notes to each other.
An hour later I was { still } sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me.
One was blank and the other was cards { from } Kevin on which he had translated all his unpleasant feelings into words for me.
 { As } I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes.
It said, { Nobody } in this family cares about me, I'm not clever.
And you're never around to even { notice } me.
It was { true } what he had said about me.
I am here for you and you are { loved } in this family.
Since then, I try my best to { never } half notice my family members any more.
Kevin and I have a closer { relationship } now, and sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset we'll smile and say Write it on a paper cup.

We had to { clean } the desks and chairs, wash the doors and windows, and sweep the school floor.
We worked hard { until } it was getting dark.
After we finished our work, we realized that we hadn't brought our umbrellas to school { because } it wasn't raining then.
All of our classmates, { except } Xiao Ling and me, were taken home by their parents.
 { Nobody } noticed us and we felt lonely and afraid.
She asked Xiao Ling to go with her. But Xiao Ling { wouldn't } do.
I was so { moved } that tears came into my eyes.
When I got home, the rain stopped. A ray of colorful { sunshine } came out.
I'd heard the famous saying A friend in { need } is a friend indeed before, but not until this time did I understand its real meaning.
But it was when I got tired of { seeing } litter nearby and realized that no one else was going to pick it up.
I can walk there { in } three minutes.I used to love going there to play with my dog.
But one day there was { so } much litter there that I became very unhappy.
I wanted to { feel } happy going there again.
I { made } my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon.
Ten minutes { later } starting to pick up litter, my bag was full!
It makes me feel { great } to do something for the environment.
If { any } of it is recyclable, I keep it.
I { can't } understand why people drop litter.
Chinese children hope very much to go { abroad } to get a wider view of the world.
In a talk Chen told more than 300 parents and their children that life in foreign countries can be { hard } for young people.
To most children looking after themselves when studying alone in a foreign country is a big { challenge } .
To his surprise, his teachers there { hardly } pushed students to study.
And { usually } there wasn't homework.
With these education systems , we have more { spare } time and more space for thinking.
But if you don't know how to { plan } your time and money, you will not have an easy time.
Studying abroad at a young age can help students learn a foreign language { quickly } and open up their eyes, but students and parents should know about the challenges, Chen said.
 { If } you want to study abroad, try to talk to someone with experience in foreign countries .
 If you want to study abroad, try to talk to someone with { experience } in foreign countries .
The couple moved { slowly } around me in search of things they had on a list.
Can I help you { find } something?
They stopped, looked at me and said, We're looking for { old } things that look new.
Every year in the past, we tried to { begin } the year with new things.
It was a goal to have new things around us so that we had a new { direction } , new hopes and dreams for the new year, said the old man.
But nowadays we also believe that even though something is old, it { can } be new to someone who has never seen it before.
So, at the end of each year we search for things that are { useful } to no one but new to us, the old woman added.
Got it! I heard a loud { shout } .
The old woman walked slowly towards us { holding } something in her hand.
Look! It's a flower vase. Well, it looks { awful } , but it's new to us!
At least that was what I had told him-- { actually } I had an important question to ask--that had been on my mind for a couple of weeks and this was the first time I had been able to stay with him alone .

Dad... I started. And { stopped } .
They say I'm { foolish } to believe in Father Christmas anymore...it's only for little kids.
But I believe what you told me. Father Christmas is { real } .
The real life and spirit of this magical elf lives forever in your heart, my heart, Mom's heart and in the hearts and minds of { all } people who believe in the joy that giving to others brings.
The real { spirit } of Father Christmas becomes what you can give rather what you get.
Once you understand this and it becomes { part } of you, Father Christmas becomes even more exciting and more magical because you come to spirit the magic comes from you when Father Christmas lives in your heart .
Once you understand this and it becomes all of you, Father Christmas becomes even more exciting and more magical because you come to { realize } the magic comes from you when Father Christmas lives in your heart .
Do you understand what I am { trying } to tell you?
My heart was filled with pride and I'm sure my eyes were shining with { excitement } .
You're the best Father Christmas who has { ever } been in the whole world.
When it comes time in my life to { explain } the reality of Father Christmas to my children, I hope that I will be as eloquent and trying as my dad was the day I learned that the spirit of Father Christmas doesn't wear a red excitement .

But it never had any importance in my life until I { received } a watch from my father that made me responsible .
It { told } me the importance of time in my life.
I had to go to the { airport } at 9:00 a.m. to pick up my uncle Ali and take him to my father's house.
However, I forgot it { because } I was playing with my friends.
Later on that day, around 11:00 a.m., I { remembered } my uncle, but I was late for him.
He had got out of the plane and { taken } a taxi to my father's house.
I { reached } my father's house at 2:00 p.m. at the same day .
My father looked at me angrily. I said hi to him and my { tired } uncle.
My father asked me to sit next to him and handed me this watch which was a gift from { him } .
Then he said, Essa, did you have fun { with } your friends today?
What you did was not very nice and you should be sorry for your { actions } .
I hope today you have learned something { important } .
I learned a lesson from my father: to respect time and { never } be late.
The watch is important to me, not because of its { price } , but because of the lesson that I learned from it.
Once he was hurt, everybody at Boston University was { sorry } .
People all over the country { talked } about John Thomas and often asked, Will he ever jump again?
John's mother went to the hospital to see her son. She looked at his { broken } leg.
Then she looked into his { eyes } .
She knew what her son would { do } .
You're going to jump again, John, I know it, she said. { Everything } will be all right.
If John hoped to jump again, he would have a { lot } to do.
Soon his { bed } looked like a machine shop!
It was May when John { left } the hospital.
But take care of that foot. John took only { short } walks at first.
He exercised { before } his body cried for a rest.
Some days later, he exercised a little { more } .
In late summer John went back to { school } .
Football wasn't his favorite, but he had to get that leg { strong } again!
To { see } a champion fighting back is a wonderful thing to watch.
People { avoided } coming into such a dirty place and the poor man was lonely and sad every day.
One day, the poor man dropped in on a wise old man and asked him for { advice } about changing his life.
The old man gave him a beautiful vase and said, This is a magic vase that will bring you { happiness } .
The poor man looked at the vase { surprisedly } .
It.s not right for something so beautiful to be { empty } .
 { But } he was still not satisfied .
His house turned into { comfortable } place immediately.
Most of us get one from our { appearance } ,way of dressing,or personality .
But for cities,the meaning of their nicknames has { much } more to it than that .
Many big cities have { nicknames } ,like New York--The Big Apple,London--The Great Smog,and Rome--The Eternal City.Why do cities have these nicknames?
 { In } the 1920s,there were many races in New York .
People called the { prizes } of these races apples .
A famous writer first called New York the Big Apple, { because } New York is a place where many people would like to visit : the biggest prize of all .

 { At } the age of six months she could already say a few words.
But unluckily, before she was two years old, she was badly { ill } .

 { With } the help of the teacher, she began to see and hear the world around her .
Through her { hands } .
The teacher took Helen for long walks, and { told } her about all the beautiful sights.
Her story has brought new { hope } to many blind and deaf people.
It has given light to those in darkness and encouraged { them } to live and work.

We went over and asked what { happened } to him.
We told him not to worry about it and then we tried to { call } his mother with the phone number he gave us.
Twenty minutes later, his { mother } turned up.
That day we not only enjoyed the { beauty } of the Great Wall, but also felt the warmth of the society.
If { everyone } can give a helping hand to others, the world around us will be more beautiful.
They spend the { short } breaks running, playing, and shouting happily before going back to the classroom again.
But { how } should students spend their free time outside school?
Students can make their own { money } and learn more about the real world .
 { However } , it seems that, in China, parents worry so much about their children's studies that they would prefer to see their children taking most of their free time studying and preparing for all those exams .

It is natural for { parents } to feel that way in China, but I believe the answer lies in balance.
Sometimes, Western school children work { free } hours after school to make money, and so they become too tired to listen in class or have no time for homework.
But Chinese students spend { so } much time exams their studies that all else becomes less important until they want that new MP4 player .

When I showed it to her, some students in my class noticed and began to talk among themselves { quietly } .
Hey, could you help us change our grades? We'll { pay } for it.
I could not believe what I heard. I could get paid for something very { easy } .
The next day, my English teacher { asked } me to help him out again.
When he was not paying { attention } , I changed their grades from Fs to As.
I soon became very { popular } among my friends.
Everything was going fine { until } I was called into the headmaster's office.
I don't want to { believe } what your teacher said, but I have to.
No, I said finally. I didn't realize how { serious } my behavior had been.
I had disappointed my teacher and the headmaster. And there was no way { back } .
I had to leave my school. That was a good { lesson } for me.
My name's Simon white. I'm a student .We have some { rules } at school and at home.
We can't { arrive } at school late.
We can't stay out late { on } school nights.
Some students think these rules are { bad } and they don't like them.
 { But } I don't agree with them.
I think these rules can help { us } a lot.
If( ) we don't have them, { how } can we do well in our studies?
For example, our teachers { ask } us to clean our classroom every day.
If your parents let you go to bed early and you don't listen to them, you { can't } get up on time next morning.
The first two { floors } there were for persons requiring help in taking care of themselves.
We sang { beautifully } for them.
As we were { singing } on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer , most of them stared at the walls or floor.
However, one lady { caught } my eye.
They weren't the songs that we were singing, at least they didn't { sound } like that.
As we got { nearer } with each song, she did as well.
The louder we got, the louder she got. { As } she was singing, she was also reaching out to us with her hands and body .
The louder we got, the louder she got. As she was singing, she was also { reaching } out to us with her hands and body .
I knew that I should have gone over to her, but I thought that my { tasks } were to my students.
Just when I stopped feeling { sorry } about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, showed me what the holiday season is really about.
Justin also { noticed } the same lady.
The difference between us is that he { acted } on her needs, but I didn't.
He looked this aged lady in her eyes and with his actions said, You are important, and I will take my { time } to let you know that.
No { words } can completely describe that touching moment...
It { took } a boy to teach me, a man, about kindness and love.

And there is also a factory near our house, and that { makes } a lot of noise, too.

We were very sorry to hear about his { illness } , I have drawn a picture for him and I will bring it with me when I visit you.
It is because they have no { interest } in sports?
It may not be true. They often say they have { much } more important things to do.
They have to get themselves ready for all kinds of exams and tests in school, so many of them almost { become } bookworms.
In the past in the summer holidays, they could do { anything } they like, but now they have to spend all their time preparing for exams.
So { studies } have kept them away from going in for sports.
Because of the pressure ( ) from their parents and teachers, they have to work harder and spend most of their time on { books } .
As for the students themselves, they don't want to fail the exams { because } they want to continue their further studies.
So it becomes necessary to give all of their spare time to their studies and { give } up their school sports.

People who have savings are not { worried } when a car breaks down, or someone becomes sick.
They know that they will be okay if they lose a job, and it takes time to find a new { one } .
By teaching your children to save money and plan for the future, you are in control of where you spend your money, and what you do { with } it.

Just before 12 o'clock, everyone { counts } down from 10, 9, 8 ... As soon as it' s 12 o'clock, everyone shouts very loudly, Happy New Year!
Suddenly there { are } fireworks and special drinks.
Sometimes people sing an old song { called } Auld Lang Syne .
Some families get together for a special { meal } with grandparents, aunts and uncles.
When the weather is { fine } , many families go out for a walk.
I will work harder at school. Or I won't spend so much time { playing } video games.
So it does not matter how they celebrate, for people in countries all over the world, it is a time to { say } goodbye to the old year, and to welcome the new.
And it was my first { day } at my new school.
I was walking alone slowly and { worrying } about lots of things.
Suddenly a girl who was { riding } a bike on ice fell down.
 { Without } thinking, I went over and helped her.
She said { Thanks } with a smile and then rode away.
The teacher led me to the { classroom } and introduced me to the class.

As I was wondering { what } to do, an English book appeared in front of me.
I studied hard and { did } well in all the subjects, so the questions were not difficult for me.
 { But } I stopped when I read the last one : What is the hobby of the woman that cleans the school ?

Di Renjie appeared { as } the main character in a number of crime novels and films.
In these novels and films, Detective Dee { solved } many cases.
The first { rule } of solving cases is that you need a good memory.

Even though you are mentally healthy, it doesn't { mean } that you don't have a mental health problem.
We all have times when we feel down or { stressed } .

We send our children to school to { prepare } them for their future work and life.
Nearly everything they study at school has some practical use in their life, but is that the { only } reason they go to school?
There is { more } in education than just learning facts.

I started to talk with the other students and { made } friends.
Day by day, I became { closer } to everyone in my class.
One day, I asked him why he smiled, but he couldn't { stop } smiling at me!
It doesn't matter because all the { dark } day have gone.
So smile at the world and it will { smile } back.
Think about { why } you make friends with them.

Then, I saw his { hand } go up and he waved back .

I { stood } on the chair for a few minutes and then I invited everyone to do the same.
I wanted them to look at the room from { up } there.
After everyone had done it, I asked the group to think about how { different } the room looked when they changed their perspective .
Then I asked them to { consider } their bosses.
Was this the same person who had seen their good { qualities } and hired them?
Do they remember how happy they were to be { chosen } for the job?
He said I looked at him and asked if he had { ever } said thank you to his boss for the opportunity to make a living.
He answered no. He told me his { life } changed that night.
He went back to work with a { thank-you } card to his boss.

She was { surprised } and then looked carefully.
It was a few seconds { before } she realized that the dog's eyes were open.
She greeted in a soft voice to show she was { friendly } .The bull dog shook when hearing her voice.
Andi inched closer and { dropped } some water into the dog's mouth.
He tried to stand up but failed. { Something } was wrong with his left front leg.
Andi called her husband, Jason, but he didn't { answer } .She knew that if she didn't carry the dog down the mountain, he would die.She carefully put her arms under the dog's body.
He was so { weak } that he fell into her chest.
 { Even } her arms and back started aching, she didn't give up.
The trip up had taken 30 minutes { while } going back down took twice that.
He and their son, Justin, jumped into the car and drove to pick up Andi quickly.Later that morning, an X-ray { showed } that the bull dog was badly hurt, he was likely to lose his left leg.

He didn't contact his father for a whole year { until } one day he saw an old man who looked like his father in the street.

Suddenly, a car key { dropped } from an envelope behind the book.
It had a tag .On the tag was the { date } of his graduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.

It's true that parents often find it { difficult } to get on well with their children.
In fact, they seem to forget { how } they themselves felt when they were young.
It's one of their ways to show that they're grown up and they can { face } any difficulties.
Most of them plan things ahead, at least in the back of their minds, and don't like their { plans } to be broken by something unexpected.
Young people often { cause } their parents angry at their choices in clothes, in hobbies and in music.
But they don't { mean } to cause any trouble.
For many years, you will be completely under your parents' { control } .
If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility , they will certainly believe you, and you can do { what } you want to do.

He showed him some of his new pictures again and { asked } him what he thought of them.
The honest man said { nothing } but turned back to the soldiers and said, Put me into prison!
What will you do to make sure you reach your goals? There are { three } main steps .
First, sit down and { write } your dreams out.
Imagine yourself at the end of the year or maybe { in } five years.
What do you see? { How } do people see you?
What are you doing? Are you { successful } ?
It's a vision of how you { see } yourself in the future.
 { Second } come the goals.
If you want to be rich, tell how much { money } you need to be rich.
If you want { good } grades, tell what you mean by 'good'.
In fact, the more specific the goal is, the { easier } it will be to get it.
They tell { exactly } what you will do and when you will do it.
When you think about what you will do, don't use words like ' { try } ' or 'maybe'.
Every day or every week you can ask, 'Did I { do } this?'

But Love decided to stay. When the island was { almost } sinking, Love asked for help.
First, Love asked Richness, Can you { take } me with you?

It was Time, Knowledge answered. But { why } did Time help me?
Mr. Evans lives in a city. He was a { teacher } three years ago.
He taught well and his students { liked } him and he decided to work in the middle school all his life.
But a bad thing { changed } everything.
The children saw a lot of { interesting } things and had a good time there.
But on their way to school, their { bus } hit by a truck because the young driver drank a lot.

So { almost } everybody meets with the failure in his life.
However, different people have different { ways } to deal with the failure.
They seem to think that it is the { end } of the world.
Others, on the other hand, don't take failure { seriously } .
If we are afraid of the failure and always feel { upset } , and don't try our best to change ourselves, we may meet with more and more failures.
But as long as we are hopeful and brave to face them, and never give up, we will { become } successful and our dreams will come true some day.
But if we never give up and { always } do little by little, it will make a big difference.

I have forgotten the math question my second-grade teacher, Joyce Cooper asked that day, but I will never forget my { answer } .
As soon as the number left my mouth, the whole class started { laughing } .
Mrs. Cooper fixed them with a firm look. Then she said: We're all here to { learn } .
Another time, Mrs. Cooper asked us to write a { report } about what we hoped to do with our lives.
I wrote: I want to be a { teacher } like Mrs. Cooper.
She wrote on my report, You would make an outstanding teacher { because } you are determined and you try hard.
I was to carry those { words } in my heart for the next 27 years.
Then one day I thought of my { dream } of how I wanted to help children.

The boy didn't like eating { fruits } very much.
The more he looked at the apple, the { hungrier } he felt and the more he wanted it.
He began to { jump } up and down, as high as he could, at the top of each jump stretching his arms to get the apple.
Still it remained out of { reach } .
Not giving up, he thought, if he had something to { stand } on, he could reach it.
His school bag wouldn't give enough height and he didn't want to { break } the things inside, like his lunch box, pencil case, and Gameboy.
Looking { around } , he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, but he found nothing that he could use .

However, the boy of our story was a { smart } one, even if he couldn't always get what he wanted.
There's { nothing } more I can do to get the apple.
That is unchangeable. But we should try to { change } our feelings.

The next morning I was very tired. As I was having breakfast the { newspaper } arrived.

As I { grew } older, I remembered my father and I listened to many basketball games on the radio.
I always fell asleep { before } the game was over.
When I woke up in the morning, the score sheet with the { final } score on it would be lying next to me.

Electricity is one thing that we waste { most } .
Lights, TVs, { radios } and other things are often kept on even when no one is using them.
It { takes } less than a second to do it.
Fresh water is precious , { so } it shouldn't be wasted.It is only a simple matter of turning off a tap*.
I am sure { everybody } can do this easily if he wants to.
I told her we had wasted so much { food } .
