I remember sitting in that dark hall listening to Mr. Zigler { rise ### do ### put ### raise } everyone's spirits up to the ceiling.
I { left ### came ### arrived ### reached } there feeling like I could do anything.
When we got to the car, I turned to my father and said, Dad, I want to { get ### hope ### make ### cheer } people feel like that.
My father asked me { that ### what ### which ### if } I meant.
A(An) { dream ### idea ### girl ### speaker } was born.
 { After ### Before ### Because ### While } a four-year relationship with Fortune 100 Company beginning as a sales-trainer and ending as a regional sales manager, I left the company at the height of my career .
 After a four-year relationship with Fortune 100 Company { beginning ### working ### acting ### regarding } as a sales-trainer and ending as a regional sales manager, I left the company at the height of my career .
 After a four-year relationship with Fortune 100 Company beginning as a sales-trainer and ending as a regional sales manager, I left the company at the height of my { life ### love ### money ### career } .
Many people were { disappointed ### moved ### surprised ### delighted } that I would leave after earning a six-figure income .
And they wondered { when ### why ### if ### how } I would risk everything for a dream.
I made my { plan ### promise ### decision ### mind } to start my own company and leave my worryingless position after surprised a regional sales meeting .
I made my career to start my own company and leave my worryingless position after { attending ### joining ### entering ### holding } a regional sales meeting .
The vice-president of our company made a { newspaper ### book ### report ### speech } that changed my life.
After giving us a { day ### instant ### week ### moment } to write down the three wishes, he then asked us, Why do you need a why ?
After giving us a surprised to write down the three wishes, he then asked us, Why do you need a { love ### worker ### god ### company } ?
I realized that { everything ### anything ### nothing ### something } I had accomplished in the past had prepared me for this moment.
A motivational speaker was { alive ### dead ### missing ### born } .
Having made that decision, I was immediately { examined ### searched ### found ### tested } .
One week after I gave notice, my husband was laid off from his job, and now we had no { help ### harm ### income ### money } .
And I was able to book several { selling ### speaking ### writing ### listening } engagements with new customers.
The first two { rooms ### buildings ### floors ### groups } there were for persons requiring help in taking care of themselves .
The first two floors there were for persons requiring { comfort ### help ### music ### happiness } in taking care of themselves .
As we were { singing ### meeting ### gathering ### dancing } on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer , most of them help off at the walls or floor .
As we were floors on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer , most of them { glared ### shut ### paid ### stared } off at the walls or floor .
However, one lady { looked ### caught ### escaped ### hurt } my eye.
They weren't the songs that we were singing, at least they didn't { appear ### hear ### sound ### feel } like that.
As we got { higher ### nearer ### faster ### louder } with each song, she did as well.
The louder we got, the louder she got. { As ### Because ### Since ### Though } she was singing, she was also caught out to us with her hands and body .
The louder we got, the louder she got. stared she was singing, she was also { moving ### reaching ### coming ### spreading } out to us with her hands and body .
I knew that I should have gone over to her, but I thought that my { interests ### abilities ### feelings ### responsibilities } were to my students.
People who worked at the care center could { speak ### attend ### object ### compare } to her, I thought.
Just when I stopped feeling { guilty ### sure ### afraid ### scary } about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, also louder the same lady .
Just when I stopped feeling sound about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, also { feared ### avoided ### helped ### noticed } the same lady .
The difference between us is that he { called ### acted ### insisted ### kept } on her needs, but I didn't.
Justin looked this aged lady in her { tears ### hands ### eye ### face } and said, You're important, and I will take my As to let you know that .
Justin looked this aged lady in her louder and said, You're important, and I will take my { body ### flower ### time ### cheek } to let you know that .
Tears felt down her face. No { words ### poems ### expressions ### songs } can completely describe that touching moment.
It took a boy to { help ### waste ### cause ### teach } me about kindness and love.
Justin's example of a complete, selfless attitude toward another was a { message ### lesson ### activity ### class } that I'll never forget.
He was the teacher that day, and I consider myself { clever ### foolish ### lucky ### right } to have witnessed his lesson.
If you are grateful, you naturally { open ### make ### stand ### take } yourself up to receive all kinds of blessings and good things in life.
You can receive almost everything you want { easily ### correctly ### truly ### clearly } .
If you want recovery soon, start by feeling grateful that you are still { lovely ### alive ### lively ### living } .
If it is more money that you want, start being grateful for whatever { amount ### number ### kind ### plenty } of money you already have.
You see, showing gratitude is the key to every { terrible ### negative ### positive ### confusing } thing in life.
It is the key to successful relationships, it is the key to successful futures and it is the key to { leading ### taking ### enjoying ### looking } healthier and happier lives.
One of my favorite { mottos ### rules ### habits ### word } is If you learn to appreciate more of what you already have, you will find yourself having more to appreciate.
Something as { pleasant ### wonderful ### short ### moving } as a Thank you for being in my life or I appreciate having you here with me , can go a long way.
So maybe your wife is not very { lazy ### beautiful ### careless ### organized } around the house, but she's great at cooking your favorite dishes .
So maybe your wife is not very organized around the house, but she's great at cooking your favorite { vegetables ### dishes ### beef ### drinks } .
Or, maybe your child { painted ### stopped ### spilled ### threw } milk all over your new shirt right before you walked out the door for work, but usually he makes you laugh so much and makes you feel like the luckiest parent in the world.
I strongly { persuade ### advise ### demand ### suggest } you to make a promise to yourself for the next week.
Decide to wake up every morning and think of at least 5 things that you are { grateful ### concerned ### anxious ### upset } for.
Then say them out loud. You will notice a smile on your face without even { pretending ### looking ### trying ### smiling } .
In 30 days you will feel completely renewed. This is the { disadvantage ### power ### award ### consequences } of being grateful!
To make Jane live a { happy ### poor ### busy ### sad } life, Mother was very careful about spending money.
 { Though ### However ### Although ### Or } , Jane didn't understand her.
Every day Mother was busy with her { writing ### housework ### work ### research } while Jane was studying at school, so they had little time to enjoy themselves.

Jane was in danger because she had hurt her head seriously and { hair ### blood ### tears ### jewels } dropped on the snow.
She cut her wrist { carefully ### slowly ### immediately ### hardly } and then bright red blood dropped down on the snowfield.
A red SOS was on the snow. At last Jane { cried ### died ### woke ### survived } , but Mother died.

Later my husband and I moved from New York to New Jersey where our neighbor, whose cat had { recently ### lastly ### firstly ### never } had kittens, asked us if we would like one.
We were afraid that Sam would not be { sad ### excited ### disappointed ### glad } , but we made up our minds to take a kitten .
We were afraid that Sam would not be glad , but we made up our { minds ### hearts ### heads ### brains } to take a kitten .
She { walked ### climbed ### raced ### hid } around running after imaginary mice and squirrels and jumped from table to chair very minds , so we named her Lightning .
She glad around running after imaginary mice and squirrels and jumped from table to chair very { slowly ### quickly ### carefully ### bravely } , so we named her Lightning .
At { last ### noon ### night ### first } , Sam and Lightning were not close to each other.
But slowly, as the days went on, Lightning started { leaving ### following ### hating ### catching } Sam.
When I took { neither ### both ### either ### any } one out of the house, the other was always quickly by the door when we returned .
When I took raced one out of the house, the other was always { waiting ### sleeping ### crying ### barking } by the door when we returned .
That was the { road ### path ### way ### street } it was for years.
Then, without any { words ### diseases ### fear ### warning } , Sam suddenly died of a weak heart.
This time, there was no Sam for Lightning to greet and no way to { talk ### explain ### think ### write } why she would never see her friend again.
In the { days ### months ### seasons ### years } that followed, Lightning seemed heartbroken.
She could not { express ### tell ### report ### say } me in words that she was waiting , but I could see the pain and way in her eyes whenever anyone opened the front door .
She could not either me in words that she was { enjoying ### doing ### suffering ### missing } , but I could see the pain and way in her eyes whenever anyone opened the front door .
She could not either me in words that she was waiting , but I could see the pain and { disappointment ### anger ### gathered ### fun } in her eyes whenever anyone opened the front door .
The weeks { came ### went ### gathered ### walked } by, and the cat's sorrow seemed to be lifting.
One day as I walked into our living room, I { seemed ### appeared ### happened ### meant } to have a look at the floor next to our sofa where we had a sculptured replica of Sam that we had bought a few years before.
 { Running ### Laying ### Playing ### Lying } next to the statue, one arm wrapped around the statue's neck, was Lightning, sleeping with her best warning .
 way next to the statue, one arm wrapped around the statue's neck, was Lightning, sleeping with her best { friend ### enemy ### sofa ### chair } .
That night, Joe came back home very late, pulling his heavy legs, obviously tired.He then sat down by the window, { lifting ### raising ### hanging ### combing } his head.
Hearing her husband back, Kay { walked ### looked ### kept ### stole } out of the kitchen, but to her surprise , Joe sat still, without movement .
Hearing her husband back, Kay walked out of the kitchen, but to her { anger ### joy ### surprise ### disappointment } , Joe sat still, without movement .
Hearing her husband back, Kay walked out of the kitchen, but to her surprise , Joe sat still, without { hope ### movement ### patience ### smile } .
Immediately Kay { said ### sensed ### told ### did } something unusual .
She went over to Joe and asked, Tell me, my dear, any { lucky ### exciting ### new ### bad } news ?
Well, I have to say that things are not in our { favor ### way ### place ### sight } .
It seems that I have no { time ### thought ### chance ### wish } to defeat my opponent .
He's much more { interesting ### experienced ### lovely ### fit } , for he's been holding the position for nearly four years, and people think he's done a favor job .
He's much more bad , for he's been holding the position for nearly four years, and people think he's done a { good ### poor ### beautiful ### funny } job .
Many signs show that he's in the { success ### office ### lead ### government } .
Oh, really? But I still believe you have our own { people ### reasons ### rights ### advantages } .
You're new, so people have reasons to { force ### expect ### order ### ask } you to do better .
So let's go to the voters and tell hem, 'Give Joe Hart a chance, and he'll show you who's your better { choice ### friend ### leader ### person } Their next three weeks were spent good different neighborhoods, going to all kinds of parties, and making speeches at universities and gatherings .
So let's go to the voters and tell hem, 'Give Joe Hart a chance, and he'll show you who's your better experienced Their next three weeks were spent { helping ### visiting ### inviting ### traveling } different neighborhoods, going to all kinds of parties, and making speeches at universities and gatherings .
Even Judy and Julie, their small children, went from door to door, { answering ### repeating ### showing ### offering } their Please vote for our daddy, Joe Hart !
The night before the { final ### next ### first ### close } vote, the whole Hart family were too lead to fall asleep .
The night before the good vote, the whole Hart family were too { eager ### sorry ### anxious ### happy } to fall asleep .
The moment before the final result was declared, their { breaths ### worries ### tongues ### hearts } were brought to their mouths, but at last they all lead and burst into tears .
The moment before the final result was declared, their good were brought to their mouths, but at last they all { left ### arrived ### laughed ### jumped } and burst into tears .
 { Yet ### But ### So ### Since } the two words I most commonly spoke to my child were: Hurry up.
But almost three years ago I made my promise to slow down and I began my journey to pay more attention to what 43 { gives ### wins ### loses ### matters } in life.
Actually, my younger { daughter ### sister ### student ### guide } often reminds me of why I must keep trying to slow down.
The two of us had taken a bike ride to the 45 { church ### park ### supermarket ### hospital } .
After buying a cool ice cream for her, my daughter sat down at a table46 { entirely ### carefully ### carelessly ### happily } looking at the ice cream she held in her hand.
Do I have to rush, Mama? I nearly { cried ### hated ### wondered ### burst } .
Perhaps the pains of a 49 { difficult ### worried ### hurried ### terrified } life don't ever completely disappear, I thought sadly.
As my child looked up at me waiting to know { when ### if ### when ### what } she could take her time, I knew I had a choice .
I could sit there in { delight ### trouble ### sorrow ### peace } thinking about the number of times when I told my child to rush through life .
I could sit there in sorrow thinking about the number of times when I told my child to { care ### ignore ### relax ### rush } through life .
. . , or I could just try to do things { slowly ### similarly ### sadly ### freely } .
I chose the latter You don't have to rush. Just take your time, I said { angrily ### fluently ### kindly ### nervously } .
Then we { raised ### sat ### shook ### trembled } side by side talking merrily.
There were even moments when we sat in { trouble ### excitement ### agreement ### silence } , only smiling at each other .
When she got to the last bite , she held out the ice cream for me. I { saved ### threw ### struck ### rushed } the last bite for you, Mama, my daughter said silence .
When she got to the last bite , she held out the ice cream for me. I sat the last bite for you, Mama, my daughter said { loudly ### rudely ### proudly ### hurriedly } .
I gave my child a little time...and in return , she gave me her last bite and reminded me that things taste sweeter and love comes { harder ### better ### worse ### easier } when you stop rushing through life.
The old man was waiting for a ride across the { town ### river ### country ### island } .
The wait seemed { meaningless ### useless ### careless ### endless } .
Anxiously, he { watched ### asked ### waved ### approached } as several horsemen came around the bend .
Finally, as the { coming ### leaving ### next ### last } rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a snow statue, the old man caught the rider's eye and said, Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side ?
Finally, as the last rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a snow statue, the old man { missed ### caught ### avoided ### saw } the rider's eye and said, Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side ?
Then another, and another. There doesn't appear to be a passage way by { bus ### car ### foot ### horse } .
Seeing the old man was unable to { feel ### push ### lift ### stand } his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman got down and helped the old man onto the horse.
As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's { honesty ### courage ### enthusiasm ### curiosity } caused him to ask, Sir, I notice that you let several other riders go by without making a(n) lift to get a ride .
As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's foot caused him to ask, Sir, I notice that you let several other riders go by without making a(n) { choice ### stop ### effort ### scene } to get a ride .
Then I came up and you { immediately ### hurriedly ### friendly ### strangely } asked me for a ride.
The old man replied, I've been { in ### out ### around ### beyond } here for some time.
He continued, I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no { concern ### doubt ### chance ### reason } for my situation.
But when I looked into your eyes, { meaning ### kindness ### seriousness ### help } was evident.
I knew, then and there , that your gentle spirit would { offer ### create ### find ### welcome } the opportunity to give me help in my time of around .
I knew, then and there , that your gentle spirit would immediately the opportunity to give me help in my time of { need ### danger ### fortune ### happiness } .
Those heartwarming comments { influenced ### excited ### touched ### hit } the horseman deeply.
May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I { happen ### try ### disagree ### fail } to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.
Through the years I would36 guess at the correct answer.When I was young,I thought { wealth ### health ### sound ### sight } was very important to us as humans,so I said, My ears,Mummy.
She said, No.Many people are { blind ### deaf ### ill ### foolish } .But you keep thinking about it and I will ask you again soon.
Several years passed before she asked me again.Since making my first { discovery ### decision ### attempt ### suggestion } ,I had often thought over the question.So this time I told her, Mummy,it must be our eyes.
She looked at me and said, You are40 { learning ### thinking ### growing ### changing } fast,but the answer is not correct because there are many people who are blind.
 { Before ### Till ### Beyond ### Over } the years,Mother asked me a couple more times and always her response to my answer was, No,but you are getting smarter every year,my child .
 Over the years,Mother asked me a couple more { ways ### things ### questions ### times } and always her response to my answer was, No,but you are getting smarter every year,my child .
 Over the years,Mother asked me a couple more times and always her response to my answer was, No,but you are getting { stronger ### taller ### smarter ### nicer } every year,my child .
Then last year,my grandpa died .Everyone was heartbroken.Everybody was crying.My mum looked at me when it was our { duty ### turn ### pity ### chance } to say our final goodbye to Grandpa.
I was { shocked ### satisfied ### interested ### excited } when she was asking me this now .
I always thought this was a { game ### test ### match ### secret } between her and me .
She saw the { worry ### puzzlement ### regret ### pain } on my face and told me .
This question is very important.It shows that you have really { enjoyed ### found ### disliked ### lived } your life.
I saw her eyes well up with tears.She said: My dear,the most important body part is your { shoulders ### feet ### hands ### hair } .
She replied, No,it is { how ### because ### why ### whether } on them a crying friend or a loved one can rest his or her head .
I only hope that you have enough { respect ### favor ### love ### fun } and friends and that you will have a shoulder to cry shoulders when you need it .
I only hope that you have enough lived and friends and that you will have a shoulder to cry { by ### on ### above ### for } when you need it .
Then and there I understand the most important body part is not a { valuable ### useful ### selfish ### precious } one.It is sympathetic to the pain of others .
She told me that she had { booked ### decorated ### listed ### mailed } it in advance to make sure it would arrive at my house weeks before the holiday .
She told me that she had mailed it in advance to make sure it would arrive at my house weeks before the { appointment ### deadline ### holiday ### party } .
Cathy checked the tracking number every { year ### morning ### week ### month } with Canada Post, and every evening she would call me to find out if there was any sign of it on our end.
The { complaint ### conversation ### discussion ### quarrel } always started with questions about the package, but twenty minutes later we would still be morning .
The holiday always started with questions about the package, but twenty minutes later we would still be { chatting ### arguing ### kidding ### scolding } .
We talked about our family, such as parents, our kids, { gifts ### secrets ### husband ### clothing } and so on.
We had never made so much { food ### time ### achievement ### money } for each other!
By Christmas Eve we finally had to { consider ### ignore ### accept ### study } the fact that the package was chatting lost .
By Christmas Eve we finally had to conversation the fact that the package was { entirely ### simply ### mostly ### suddenly } lost .
On Christmas morning, Cathy got on the phone with everyone in my { restaurant ### office ### house ### class } and told them what she had sent.
Later on, after a big Christmas dinner, I had forgotten all about the { terrible ### outstanding ### big ### missing } package when there was a knock on the door.
Who could it be at such a time? As I { opened ### locked ### left ### watched } the door, a man was standing there.
I { understand ### forget ### know ### believe } this is yours.
Just then I { expected ### dreamed ### realized ### remembered } that it had been delivered to the wrong address.
I just got home from vacation, he explained, { because ### but ### or ### so } I wanted you to have this in time to open for Christmas.
I thanked this { generous ### honest ### polite ### kind } stranger for taking so much trouble to missing this gift to us on Christmas Day, and opened thanked God that the package had been lost in the first place .
I thanked this house stranger for taking so much trouble to { show ### present ### return ### offer } this gift to us on Christmas Day, and opened thanked God that the package had been lost in the first place .
I thanked this house stranger for taking so much trouble to missing this gift to us on Christmas Day, and { silently ### carefully ### gently ### actually } thanked God that the package had been lost in the first place .
The real gift that holiday season was the new { connection ### guide ### recognition ### closeness } to my sister who lives far away from us.
She had been a science teacher by { profession ### accident ### birth ### mistake } ,but she also was a very creative person .
She had been a science teacher by profession ,but she also was a very { energetic ### generous ### creative ### conservative } person .
They were the most interesting dolls I'd ever seen ; each was very { far ### safe ### free ### different } from the other .
By talking to Doris I learned she'd { taken ### quitted ### prepared ### organized } a class in doll making .
One day while I was in her room she took one of the dolls out of the case to { flatter ### show ### comfort ### upset } me .
This doll was very { common ### cheap ### expensive ### unusual } with fine artistic work .
I was { disappointed ### amazed ### terrified ### annoyed } that anyone could do such unique work .
As Doris was { turning ### bending ### mending ### shaking } the doll carefully in her hand,I could see a slight break in the skirt .
I was { sorry ### proud ### curious ### content } to know what happened .
Doris said that on the way to class she { burned ### bumped ### replaced ### decorated } the side of the skirt .
She expressed how scared she was and almost didn't go to { hospital ### church ### class ### work } at a11 .
When it came her { turn ### task ### honor ### choice } to show the doll to the teacher,she had to point out the class in the skirt .
When it came her bumped to show the doll to the teacher,she had to point out the { spot ### patch ### hole ### break } in the skirt .
Doris felt for sure that the doll would be { destroyed ### appreciated ### rejected ### removed } because of it .
Much to her surprise the teacher told her she was just going to { ignore ### value ### notice ### assess } this break and grade the doll on the other good turn it had .
Much to her surprise the teacher told her she was just going to class this break and grade the doll on the other good { talents ### quantities ### varieties ### qualities } it had .
Doris shared that this remark and { responsibility ### attitude ### habit ### standard } from the teacher changed her life .
This teacher could have made Doris feel { ashamed ### shocked ### puzzled ### overjoyed } by her mistake.But because of her willingness to ignore the mistake,Doris was sharing her kindness with the next generation.
As I was talking about how I was studying English, he seemed to be { tired ### moved ### interested ### amazed } by gently shaking his head,shrugging his shoulders, saying, You don't say!You don't say!
I was puzzled.I thought, Perhaps this is { just ### only ### not ### really } a good topic.
I had { rather ### better ### never ### like } change the topic.So I said to him, Well, shall we talk about the Great Wall?
By the way , have you ever { gone ### visited ### seen ### been } there?
Certainly,everyone { from ### back ### with ### in } home will laugh at me if I leave China without seeing it .
Certainly,everyone back home will laugh at me if I leave China without seeing { it ### them ### anything ### something } .
He was deep in thought when I began to talk { as ### to ### with ### like } a guide.
The Great Wall is one of the wonders in the world. We are very { glad ### satisfied ### proud ### found } of it.
Soon I was interrupted again by his order-- You don't say! I { couldn't ### wouldn't ### shouldn't ### mustn't } help asking, proud do you ask me not to talk about it ?
Soon I was interrupted again by his order-- You don't say! I like help asking, { How ### When ### Why ### Where } do you ask me not to talk about it ?
Well, I didn't ask you to do so, He answered,greatly { encouraged ### frightened ### pleased ### surprised } .I said, Didn't you say 'you don't say'?
Hearing this, the English laughed to tears.He began to { explain ### shout ### prove ### say } , 'You don't say' actually means really.
It is an { experience ### expression ### explanation ### example } of surprise.
Perhaps you don't pay attention to English idioms. { From ### Since ### By ### Only } then did I know I had made a fool of surprised .
Perhaps you don't pay attention to English idioms. Why then did I know I had made a fool of { me ### myself ### mine ### somebody } .
So often they get { ignored ### appreciated ### acknowledged ### forgiven } , and occasionally they come back to bite you!
Then, just last week, after a long travel, I found myself { examined ### trapped ### confused ### delayed } at a bus station.
The bus was four hours late! So, I guess I wasn't in a good { habit ### place ### mood ### situation } .
That's when a woman asked me if I had any spare { change ### time ### hand ### energy } to help her get a bus ticket.
As I spoke, I mentally kicked myself for my { appearance ### attitude ### selfishness ### experience } and reached into my bag for some money.
As I handed her five dollars, I heard low sounds from her stomach because of real { pain ### anxiety ### hunger ### fear } .
I reached back into my bag and brought out a { souvenir ### ticket ### gift ### cake } I had bought earlier.
I handed it to her with a(n) { shout ### smile ### apology ### praise } that I hoped would make up for my earlier tone of voice.
Getting a { quick ### gentle ### good ### cold } look at her now, I realized she was extremely tired, like she had had several months of tough days !
Getting a good look at her now, I realized she was extremely tired, like she had had several months of { dark ### tough ### mysterious ### special } days !
As she took the food, a look of { relief ### regret ### doubt ### anger } washed over her.
I don't live in Milwaukee and the ticket will probably { once ### often ### sometimes ### never } be used, but I took it.
A few minutes later she came back over, apologized, and told me she was still { ashamed ### aware ### short ### proud } of five dollars.
 { Eventually ### However ### Therefore ### Besides } , the voice in my head told me I was being a fool.
Five minutes later she came back again and tried to { return ### show ### share ### earn } my twenty.
When I said it was for her so she could get something else to { do ### trade ### add ### eat } , and that I was completely serious and I wasn't taking it return , she started crying and hugged me .
When I said it was for her so she could get something else to However , and that I was completely serious and I wasn't taking it { away ### out ### back ### over } , she started crying and hugged me .
From now on, when I wonder if it is { hard ### fun ### useless ### worth } trying to help someone, I will remember that woman.
Maybe I am really making a { difference ### profit ### decision ### suggestion } for someone.
So, sure, sometimes my efforts might not be noticed, and sometimes they might come back to bite me, but they might actually { excite ### help ### educate ### inspire } another human being!
Their staring eyes don't see that I get { hardly ### mostly ### merely ### particularly } A's in school, or that I am a captain of the football team, or that I belong to positive youth organizations .
Their staring eyes don't see that I get mostly A's in school, or that I am a captain of the football team, or that I belong to { social ### local ### positive ### new } youth organizations .
All they see is that I am 6-foot-4, young, black, and male---a potential { danger ### treasure ### gift ### neighbor } to them.
White men look at me as if I am up to no good, or as if they are { better ### close ### perfect ### superior } to me.
White women just look at me with { fear ### interest ### honor ### despair } , say, sometimes they cross the street when they see my friends and me coming, or walk in the street and only get back on the sidewalk after we superior .
White women just look at me with danger , say, sometimes they cross the street when they see my friends and me coming, or walk in the street and only get back on the sidewalk after we { run ### walk ### pass ### move } .
Many people come to San Francisco to get away from the stereotypes of the cities they were born and { known ### developed ### raised ### located } in.
How can you feel at home when people are { honestly ### constantly ### hopefully ### freely } telling you to get back to Africa or Mexico ----or just back to where you belong ?
My way of dealing with this kind of thing has { changed ### formed ### strengthened ### increased } over the years.
In the past, when my friends and I would walk the streets and a hundred pairs of white eyes would look at me as if we were the lowest form of dirt, it would make us angry enough to hurt or { kill ### rob ### damage ### steal } them.
Now I'm more likely to use { actions ### deeds ### signs ### words } to defend myself against those eyes.
My cousin has even started wearing a T-shirt { writing ### printing ### telling ### saying } in big letters, NO, WHITE LADY, I DON'T' WANT YOUR PURSE.
The most painful thing is when we get those { fearful ### doubtful ### pitiful ### impressive } stares from black people, especially elderly ones.
Usually I react more { strongly ### actively ### disappointedly ### casually } to all of this than a lot of my friends do.
I just can't stand it when every day a hundred pair of eyes tell you you're not { sincere ### mature ### welcome ### gentle } .
When he was a senior, he was asked to write a { novel ### Poem ### paper ### letter } about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up .
That night he wrote a seven-page paper { reminding ### describing ### seeking ### recognizing } his goal .
He wrote it in great { detail ### total ### need ### time } and he even drew a picture of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track .
He wrote it in great detail and he even drew a { line ### signal ### sign ### picture } of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track .
But two days later he { received ### posted ### accepted ### brought } his paper back with a large red picture on the front page and a note that reads, See me after received .

But two days later he detail his paper back with a large red picture on the front page and a note that reads, See me after { all ### noon ### school ### class } .
The boy with the { dream ### tears ### ranch ### pride } went to see the teacher after class and asked, Why did I get an F?
The teacher said, This is an unrealistic dream for a { rich ### clever ### poor ### kind } young boy like you .
Owning a horse ranch { earns ### requires ### wastes ### collects } lot of money .
There's no { point ### way ### use ### idea } you could ever do it .
Then the teacher added, If you will { report ### explain ### excuse ### rewrite } this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.
The boy went home and { wrote ### thought ### complained ### laughed } about it long and hard .
He asked his { mother ### teacher ### father ### friend } what he should do .
However, I think it is a very important { work ### reason ### mind ### decision } for you .
Finally, the boy turned in the same paper making no { changes ### excuses ### corrections ### marks } at all.He stated, You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.
Years later, the boy { doubted ### realized ### improved ### dreamed } his dream.
Later, his teacher admitted when seeing his ranch, When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream { maker ### helper ### stealer ### robber } .During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams.Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours.
It was a { routine ### annual ### average ### difficult } trip, like the one he made five days every week.
He arrived, and little Joshua could not be { conveyed ### transplanted ### awakened ### convinced } from his nap.
but 12 hours later, at children's Hospital, { though ### since ### because ### as } the doctors had exhausted all attempts , little Joshua was gone .
but 12 hours later, at children's Hospital, though the doctors had exhausted all { medicine ### strength ### attempts ### spirits } , little Joshua was gone .
. . . Yes, they wanted { part ### few ### some ### all } of Joshua's usable organs to be donated.
That was not a { good ### difficult ### stupid ### wise } decision for Jim and Connie, a loving and all couple .
That was not a attempts decision for Jim and Connie, a loving and { giving ### tiring ### boring ### thinking } couple .

When Jim settled into the chair { with ### at ### by ### near } the barber's, he began to reflect on the past hours, trying to all some sense of it all .
When Jim settled into the chair attempts the barber's, he began to reflect on the past hours, trying to { get ### take ### hold ### make } some sense of it all .
 { How ### Why ### Whether ### If } had Joshua, their first-born, the child they had waited so long for, been taken so soon .
. . . he had { barely ### nearly ### seldom ### almost } begun his life .
. . . The question kept coming, and the pain in Jim's heart just { covered ### drew ### enveloped ### choked } him .
The { hairdresser ### customer ### father ### parent } stopped and stood motionless.
You're not going to believe this....but about an hour ago the customer sitting in this chair wanted me to hurry { since ### as ### so ### and } she could get to Children's Hospital.
She { arrived ### left ### stayed ### sat } here so full of joy....her prayers had been answered.
Today her baby granddaughter is receiving a { desperately ### disappointedly ### clearly ### obviously } needed transplant--a heart valve.
One warm spring day, Malcolm had been { boating ### fishing ### hunting ### swimming } for many hours, and he was hot and tired and hungry.
He hadn't { caught ### removed ### bitten ### held } even a mouse.
When he came upon a big tree, he sat down under its { way ### fur ### poster ### shade } to rest.
The egg was so white and round, pure and beautiful that he couldn't { wait ### help ### imagine ### expect } eating it.
The next morning when he woke up, he was { exciting ### secure ### amazed ### lively } to find bread and soup on his table.
I've never { smelt ### looked ### sounded ### tasted } anything so delicious, he said aloud.
He turned to find a beautiful woman standing beside the ostrich egg, { which ### whose ### who ### that } was cracked wide open.
Malcolm, you are a kind and generous man, and I will make you { intelligent ### happy ### attractive ### popular } for the rest of your life.
 { Follow ### Accept ### Admit ### Marry } me and I will always make delicious food for you.
An ostrich egg's { sister ### daughter ### mother ### son } cannot speak or cook or marry me, he said.
I will make you happy, Malcolm, she said, You must { doubt ### respond ### select ### promise } only this: you will never call me the daughter of an ostrich egg.
And so they got married. For many years they lived { in ### at ### under ### beyond } great happiness.
His wife brought him { sheep ### pigs ### cattle ### chicken } , goats and made him a chief.
But one day, Malcolm got so { puzzled ### greedy ### magical ### upset } that he was not satisfied with what he had .
But one day, Malcolm got so greedy that he was not { satisfied ### surprised ### popular ### certain } with what he had .
He quarreled with his { daughter ### mother ### wife ### grandfather } .
He said his wife was the daughter of an ostrich egg... And in a flash he was alone again, living in his hut, { wearing ### having ### preparing ### replacing } his old clothes.
He understood that he had been { informal ### artificial ### severe ### mistaken } to let greed and anger get the better of him and to break his promise to his wife.
Mitchell Joachim, an architect from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a(n) { similar ### excellent ### strange ### different } vision.
Joachim's vision is based on an idea called pleaching , where tree branches are grown so that they { luckily ### naturally ### partly ### separately } weave together.
Since the growth patterns of trees are { effected ### affected ### attempted ### intended } by wind and sunlight, it may be possible to control the way a tree develops .
Since the growth patterns of trees are affected by wind and sunlight, it may be { possible ### impossible ### important ### necessary } to control the way a tree develops .
One of the { designers ### purposes ### disadvantages ### advantages } of these designs is that trees would not have to be cut down for wood .
Joachim suggests including { compound ### chemical ### ecological ### industrial } materials such as sod , grasses and living branches in the housing designs.
This material would be able to move { for ### as ### so ### because } the house grows, Joachim said.
The trees would also give off water vapor that would assist in { cleaning ### heating ### cooling ### lighting } the homes.
Solar panels and wind would help provide { food ### energy ### beauty ### charming } .
The tree homes might even have soil pockets, { where ### which ### that ### and } plants could grow from the structure itself .
Work has already { stopped ### completed ### controlled ### begun } on Joachim's first design--a house made from 15 percent recycled and 15 percent living things.
Joachim is confident about the { pleasure ### happiness ### benefit ### importance } of his work, as he uses natural products without destroying nature.

A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, { too ### either ### often ### never } , were puzzled by the very unusual symptoms.
While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to { refer ### turn ### speak ### belong } to them.
Excuse me, said nurse Marsha Maitland, { and ### so ### as ### but } I think the baby is speak from thallium poisoning .
Excuse me, said nurse Marsha Maitland, too I think the baby is { coming ### suffering ### tired ### dying } from thallium poisoning .
 { Who ### How ### What ### Which } makes you think that?
Dr. Brown asked. Thallium poisoning is extremely { rare ### serious ### clear ### dangerous } .
A few days ago, I was reading a novel called { in ### on ### by ### about } Agatha Christie, Nurse Maitland explained.
In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are { drawn ### broadcast ### announced ### described } .
We'll carry out some tests and find out { that ### how ### what ### whether } it's thallium or not.
The { words ### tests ### examination ### book } showed that the baby had by been poisoned by thallium, a rare metal used in making optical glass .
The rare showed that the baby had { indeed ### actually ### probably ### never } been poisoned by thallium, a rare metal used in making optical glass .
He wished to find a good job. One day, he went to a company to { apply ### vote ### prepare ### wait } for a job.
He did some research on this company. When he was { contacted ### interviewed ### asked ### questioned } , everything went well.
The manager asked him some questions and he answered them { immediately ### slowly ### generally ### fluently } .
John was very satisfied with his performances and was very { grateful ### excited ### confident ### lucky } that he could get the job.
But at that moment, the manager's phone { lost ### called ### rang ### answered } .
And then he turned around and said to John, Sorry, I want to get some important { arrangement ### response ### information ### result } now.
Please give me the book with the red { cover ### picture ### character ### mark } on that desk.
John looked around and found 3 books on the desk, so John went to the desk, took one book and handed it to him { eagerly ### politely ### purposely ### quickly } .
John was { surprised ### helpless ### disappointed ### worried } and wondered why.
The manager said, There are three { methods ### results ### collections ### reasons } .
Third, I was answering the call. You should { wander ### run ### walk ### move } to the desk to save time.
These { parts ### facts ### details ### stories } showed you are not a careful person.
 { Eventually ### Seemingly ### Similarly ### Regularly } , John didn't get the job.
We can learn a(n) { subject ### idea ### skill ### lesson } from John's experience.
Some people don't { mind ### mention ### ignore ### provide } the details in our life.
But it is the details that { trouble ### count ### interest ### impress } .
Sometimes they can even { describe ### replace ### value ### determine } our success or failure.
We should form the habit of being careful and learn to keep the { selection ### importance ### balance ### competition } of quantity and quality.
We should keep it in mind that { quality ### quantity ### safety ### promise } comes first, without which quantity is of no significance.
As executives with banks, consulting firms, established law firms, and major corporations, many are now 41 { much ### never ### seldom ### well } on their way to impressive careers.
By society's 42 { policies ### standards ### experiments ### regulations } , they seem to have it made.

They made reservations at restaurants where the cost of a bottle of wine 45 { shared ### paid ### equaled ### collected } a college year's monthly rent.
The thing is, a number of them have 46 { advertised ### witnessed ### admitted ### demanded } that despite their success, they aren't happy.
Some 47 { complain ### dream ### hear ### approve } of unfriendly coworkers and feel sad for eight-hour workweeks devoted to tasks they 48 admitted .
Some 47 equaled of unfriendly coworkers and feel sad for eight-hour workweeks devoted to tasks they 48 { distribute ### hate ### applaud ### overlook } .

But what about the personal and social costs 60 { assessed ### involved ### covered ### reduced } in pursuing money over meaning?
He knew he wouldn't be in the { school ### photo ### play ### painting } .
Brad was small. Kids were always making jokes about how { foolish ### short ### nervous ### fat } he was.
Brad tried to smile, even though what Charlotte said was { sad ### true ### interesting ### worrying } .
He believed they didn't mean to { stop ### encourage ### congratulate ### hurt } him.
Two reporters named Rick and Tegan { returned ### started ### called ### arrived } half an hour later.
Time to { take ### develop ### send ### buy } photos, Tegan said.
Who do you { recognize ### remember ### want ### tell } , Rick?
Then he pointed to Jocob, Eddie, and Brad. Brad could hardly { hear ### believe ### accept ### change } it.
We'll get you guys to kneel in front of it, so it looks even { taller ### thinner ### bigger ### simpler } .
said one of the Room 5 kids. So it looks { already ### really ### only ### usually } big?
Some people laughed. Brad also gave a { hand ### smile ### speech ### chance } as he usually did.
But Rick { shook ### nodded ### held ### lowered } his head.
No, he said. I { chose ### understood ### ignored ### hated } him because he's got a huge smile two miles wide.
He looked at Brad and said, Plus, this guy is big inside, where it { happens ### hides ### matters ### appears } .
This time, Brad spoke before he could think. In my { experience ### family ### life ### heart } , I'm three miles wide.
In the doorway of a shop, a man was standing in the { dark ### bright ### dim ### colorful } light, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth.
I'm just waiting for a friend here, the man said It's a(n) { mistake ### time ### trade ### appointment } made twenty years ago.
The man struck a match and { stopped ### lighted ### burnt ### dropped } his cigar.
The light { formed ### appeared ### relieved ### showed } a pale face with a little white scar near his right eye.
Twenty years ago tonight, when I said goodbye to Jimmy Wells, my best friend to { start ### work ### look ### search } for the West to make my fortune, we agreed we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time .
Twenty years ago tonight, when I said goodbye to Jimmy Wells, my best friend to start for the West to make my fortune, we { insisted ### preferred ### agreed ### suggested } we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time .
Twenty years ago tonight, when I said goodbye to Jimmy Wells, my best friend to start for the West to make my fortune, we agreed we would meet here again exactly twenty years { for ### from ### later ### at } that date and time .
Jimmy Wells? { cried ### smiled ### wept ### choked } the man with excitement.
You have { grew ### achieved ### changed ### became } , Jimmy.
When they both looked at each other { clearly ### surprisingly ### quickly ### happily } , the man said suddenly You're not Jimmy Wells.
Twenty years is a long time, { but ### and ### or ### while } not long enough to change a man's changed .
Twenty years is a long time, cried not long enough to change a man's { character ### face ### quality ### size } .
It sometimes changes a good man into a { successful ### ordinary ### tall ### bad } one, said the tall man.
You are under { discussion ### control ### arrest ### inspiration } now.
His hand was steady when he began to read, but it { trembled ### struggled ### escaped ### understood } a little by the time he had finished.
When you lighted your cigar I saw it was the face of the man { asked ### wanted ### described ### caught } by Chicago police.
 { Anywhere ### Though ### However ### Anyway } I couldn't catch myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job.
Everything was in place , { with ### in ### by ### on } boxes under the bed and photos of her dearest friends on the wall.
I closely monitored that this time things were { important ### enjoyable ### convenient ### different } .
I began to accept that her room at home is no longer { mine ### hers ### ours ### theirs } .
I { sent ### stopped ### found ### set } myself thinking of when I held her in my arm sitting in a chair by my wife's hospital bed .
I found myself thinking of when I held her in my arm sitting in a chair by my wife's hospital { desk ### wall ### room ### bed } .
My wife changed from the day I drove this little baby home from the { kindergarten ### hospital ### school ### park } .
I saw myself differently that day, { neither ### either ### also ### too } .
The last few days { before ### after ### since ### when } she left for college, I touched her arm, her face -anything- too that when my wife and I returned home, she would not be with us and there would be before to touch .
The last few days hospital she left for college, I touched her arm, her face -anything- { wondering ### saying ### knowing ### showing } that when my wife and I returned home, she would not be with us and there would be before to touch .
The last few days hospital she left for college, I touched her arm, her face -anything- too that when my wife and I returned home, she would not be with us and there would be { nothing ### everything ### anything ### something } to touch .
Suddenly she looked up, { observing ### catching ### watching ### keeping } me staring at her, which caused her to say to her mother, Mom, Dad's looking at me funny.
She then said, It'll be { bad ### wrong ### fine ### right } , Dad.
I'll be home from school soon. I told her she would have a { whole ### comfortable ### difficult ### great } year.
I was { aware ### afraid ### sure ### sorry } that I would say something too small for what I was feeling,- nothing I only held on to our good-bye hug a little longer, a little catching .
I was knowing that I would say something too small for what I was feeling,- { but ### for ### so ### and } I only held on to our good-bye hug a little longer, a little catching .
I was knowing that I would say something too small for what I was feeling,- nothing I only held on to our good-bye hug a little longer, a little { better ### tighter ### happier ### nearer } .
Mine did not. I { imagined ### thought ### guessed ### expected } she hadn't gone.
I knew that the life she was going { across ### by ### towards ### over } was exciting and wonderful.
I remembered what the world looked like to me when everything was { good ### bright ### new ### perfect } .
On the way back home, my eyes were wet, my heart sore, and I realized that my { life ### heart ### dream ### belief } was changed forever
A few months later, I was involved in an { accident ### event ### incident ### exam } .
That new and very beautiful car was destroyed. It was clearly not my { effort ### fault ### attempt ### intention } .
It was even { luckier ### angrier ### scarier ### sadder } because my niece was asleep on the back seat and her father, my brother, was in the front passenger seat.
He was not { frightened ### nervous ### happy ### worried } , to say the least.
I { argued ### explained ### shouted ### introduced } that my speed had been up to about 55kmph.
Right, so you were doing about 50kmph... again he { reminded ### required ### resisted ### repeated } .
In a slightly { contented ### surprised ### puzzled ### annoyed } tone because I felt I wasn't being heard, I said: No!
I didn't { believe ### imagine ### realize ### think } it at the time, but I was shooting myself in the foot.
 { However ### Therefore ### Besides ### Furthermore } , I totally missed the boat on the other driver's insurance company.
I ended up getting 50 percent less than I would have from the other guy's insurance company because I had { thought ### said ### insisted ### suggested } I was doing 55km.
It suddenly { turned ### struck ### occurred ### came } me that the traffic policeman had been trying to help me out.
He hadn't { talked ### found ### minded ### noticed } about the 5kmph ; he had known something about the insurance that I had not .
He hadn't minded about the 5kmph ; he had known { something ### nothing ### anything ### everything } about the insurance that I had not .
I thought about what had { remained ### happened ### passed ### ended } over and over again.
I might have carried on insisting that I told the { reality ### course ### truth ### cause } , but I could at least have said Thank you to him instead of acting so rudely.
Sometimes the { happiest ### easiest ### worst ### hardest } thing to do is to let other people talk while you simply shut up and listen.
Never forget --- to { hear ### learn ### say ### Think } , you have to be able to listen.
Whatever is in the past is { on ### out ### down ### over } .
When you are enough { ambitious ### bitter ### sad ### desperate } to do this, you will see that moving ahead is the best definition of life .
When you are enough ambitious to do this, you will see that moving ahead is the best definition of { work ### life ### death ### leisure } .
Sure it is { boring ### surprising ### easy ### hard } for me to tell you to forget the past, life it is a whole different easy to actually do it .
Sure it is ambitious for me to tell you to forget the past, { so ### as ### yet ### after } it is a whole different easy to actually do it .
Sure it is ambitious for me to tell you to forget the past, life it is a whole different { practice ### theory ### order ### pleasure } to actually do it .
Life is a complex set of events much of which of course is real, but a large amount is just your { mind ### plan ### fact ### view } of what really happened.
Let me { explain ### deny ### admit ### prove } with an example.
I know not everyone is a football fan, but I am { deciding ### remembering ### noticing ### guessing } most have watched at least yet of a game on TV .
I know not everyone is a football fan, but I am easy most have watched at least { none ### all ### part ### series } of a game on TV .
Most games and almost all the important games are { studied ### played ### wanted ### sold } over and over on the TV screen right after the game happened.
When you watched a game, you were { doubtful ### unsure ### conscious ### certain } of the outcome, saying the player practice the ball .
When you watched a game, you were yet of the outcome, saying the player { passing ### catching ### getting ### breaking } the ball .
Then while watching the instant replay, you realized you were { seldom ### slightly ### totally ### fortunately } wrong.
In order to { keep ### concentrate ### put ### get } on your future, you should try to minimize the effects of your past.
Try to find out how much of the past that you are certain are just { mistakes ### successes ### measures ### preparations } .
The piece of furniture looked { well ### good ### bad ### big } when you finished, but it fell apart before you could guessing it to your father .
The piece of furniture looked explain when you finished, but it fell apart before you could { promise ### feed ### offer ### show } it to your father .
So don't think yourself to be a { handsome ### hardworking ### terrible ### helpful } carpenter and avoid building anything.
He was born with a slow { mood ### mind ### progress ### growth } , seemingly unable to learn.
His teacher, Doris Miller, became { satisfied ### friendly ### strict ### impatient } with him.
 { However ### Besides ### Thus ### But } , she decided to try some more.
Then she gave { all ### both ### none ### each } of them a box, and asked them to put something inside that showed new life .
Then she gave each of them a box, and asked them to put something inside that { enjoyed ### knew ### showed ### hated } new life .
The next morning, it was time to { open ### move ### repair ### use } the boxes.
Oh yes, a (an) { plant ### tree ### animal ### baby } is certainly a sign of new life, she said.
When it grows through the { sky ### ground ### water ### stone } , we know that spring is coming.
The next box contained a plastic butterfly, which { looked ### smelt ### sounded ### felt } very real.
We all know that a caterpillar { walks ### breaks ### changes ### falls } into a beautiful butterfly.
Then Doris opened the third box, and was { happy ### excited ### surprised ### nervous } to find nothing!
 { Likely ### Surely ### Nearly ### Impossibly } it must be Jeremy's, she thought.
And obviously Jeremy had not { heard ### liked ### forgotten ### understood } her instructions.
She felt very { regretful ### angry ### puzzled ### comfortable } for not having understood the task to him .
She felt very Surely for not having { told ### given ### explained ### related } the task to him .
She did not want to make Jeremy feel ashamed, { but ### so ### because ### though } she quietly set the box aside an understood for another .
She did not want to make Jeremy feel ashamed, Surely she quietly set the box aside an { reached ### care ### search ### prepare } for another .
Doris replied, But Jeremy, your box is { clear ### empty ### small ### dirty } !
You told us that he brought new life. Doris was so { pleased ### worried ### shocked ### delighted } that she couldn't speak.
Jeremy remembered { nothing ### anything ### something ### everything } she had told them.
 { Knowledge ### Experience ### Parents ### Teachers } tells us that he was right.
Good friendship is just not easily { understood ### produced ### realized ### formed } .
It is possible that we simply do not stay in one place long enough for { true ### common ### deeply ### actual } friendship to develop .
It is possible that we simply do not stay in one place long enough for true friendship to { design ### develop ### intend ### appear } .
However, there can be { no ### some ### any ### none } disagreement on the need for each of us to think carefully about the kind of friendship we want.
To most of us, friendships are considered very important, but we need to have clear in our { hearts ### actions ### minds ### thoughts } the kinds of friendship we want.
Are they to be close or { remained ### kept ### left ### stayed } at arm's length?
Do we want to { share ### owe ### spare ### own } ourselves or do we want to walk on the surface?
For some people, many friendships on the surface are { that ### very ### quite ### not } enough--and that's all right.
The sharing of { social ### personal ### good ### ordinary } experience including our tears as well as our dark dreams is the surest way to deepen friendships.
But it { can ### need ### will ### must } be undertaken slowly and carried on only if there are personal of interest and action in return .
But it quite be undertaken slowly and carried on only if there are { marks ### sights ### signs ### scenes } of interest and action in return .
What are some of the { difficulties ### differences ### advantages ### things } of friendship?
Deep relationships { cost ### spend ### take ### ask } time.
Similarly, friendships { require ### request ### depend ### suggest } actions in return.
In { other ### many ### some ### different } words, you must give as much as you take.
Unless you spend reasonable time together, talking on the phone, writing letters, doing things together, friendships will die { for ### from ### out ### away } .
In no time, { firefighters ### policemen ### friends ### neighbours } were welcomed by 5-metre-tall flames and roaring smoke.

The apartment's owner Mr. Petri and his lovely dog, Sandy, were the { causes ### results ### victims ### heroes } of the big fire.
Local firefighting hero, Costache Mugurel { battled ### lost ### pushed ### got } his way through the cruel flames to rescue the man and his pet.
Mr. Petri, { blindly ### hardly ### slightly ### seriously } injured in the fire, was rushed to hospital.
Mugurel, remembering his CPR training, passionately { patted ### beat ### examined ### touched } the chest of the dog, desperately trying to save his life.
And he began to lose hope after many { countings ### trainings ### shouts ### attempts } .
He was physically and mentally { relaxed ### exhausted ### concerned ### troubled } .
Finally he performed mouth-to-mouth on the dog, screaming { Somebody ### Everybody ### Nobody ### Anybody } gets left behind!
The on-looking crowd cheered and Mugurel began to weep with { joy ### pity ### stress ### fright } .
Like { wildfire ### wind ### disasters ### sounds } , the story of Mugurel and his newfound friend spread around the city.
According to vet experts, recovering animals via CPR is rather { common ### rare ### practical ### easy } .

The cell door { opens ### closes ### breaks ### sticks } and I hear Chief's keys clinking as other doors clang shut further down the row.

I am a puppet with people { pulling ### shaking ### winding ### casting } strings so that I eat, sleep and wake when they want me to.
I lie on my bed as night { becomes ### drops ### feels ### falls } and think the same thoughts over and over again .

Walking around the yard, I would notice my fellow prisoners reading books and writing letters to friends and family, which upset me as my { attendance ### absence ### allowance ### assistance } at school was limited.
I longed for the day when I'd be able to sit in the sun, enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a newspaper or book { in ### of ### over ### by } my choice.
I decided not to waste my time inside and, { however ### instead ### thus ### nevertheless } , make the most of all the resources available to me.
I started to learn and was { devoted ### dedicated ### determined ### decided } to realize my dream.
Now, after five years' persistence, heartache and hard work, I have { gained ### recognized ### arrived ### achieved } my goal.
Having { attended ### completed ### started ### organized } a course as a reading adviser, I can now help others to read and write.
Learning to read and write at a highter level has given me the inner strength to present myself in a more { positive ### negative ### sensitive ### passive } manner.
Learning to read and write has changed my life and this article is my first piece of proper writing, and it won't be my { best ### worst ### latest ### last } .
And I will never { forget ### read ### understand ### practice } one sentence my father used to say to me, I love you, son.
Say you love me, son. { Actually ### Simply ### Naturally ### Strangely } , I would scream, I love you, Dad.
When I was growing up, I found that I had little in { heart ### manner ### mind ### common } with my father gradually.
Sometimes we often argued about something sharply and then the argument changed into a { fight ### quarrel ### question ### discussion } .
I didn't { expect ### think ### enjoy ### remember } hearing the words I love you from my father the last time.
To tell you the truth, I couldn't honestly remember { why ### whether ### where ### when } I had last said those words to him, either.
The doctor said it was { risky ### serious ### important ### difficult } and he needed an operation at once, but he wasn't sure whether my father was able to survive it .
The doctor said it was serious and he needed an operation at once, { but ### because ### so ### for } he wasn't sure whether my father was able to survive it .
The doctor said it was serious and he needed an operation at once, but he wasn't sure whether my father was able to { remain ### master ### survive ### defeat } it .
Everything in my childhood { put ### opened ### kept ### appeared } There was a but at the other end and he replied coldly, Well, I love you, too !
Everything in my childhood serious There was a { response ### pause ### silence ### surprise } at the other end and he replied coldly, Well, I love you, too !
I { cried ### smiled ### nodded ### moved } and said, Dad, I know you love me, and when you are but , I know you will say what you want to say .
I serious and said, Dad, I know you love me, and when you are { free ### ready ### happy ### convenient } , I know you will say what you want to say .
Fifteen minutes later my mother called and { eagerly ### carefully ### excitedly ### nervously } asked, Paul, is everything OK?
Paul, I love you. I was so { touched ### amused ### encouraged ### shocked } that my tears rolled down my cheeks.
Perhaps both of us { required ### realized ### reacted ### reported } that this special moment had appeared our relationship to a new level .
Perhaps both of us survive that this special moment had { formed ### built ### taken ### increased } our relationship to a new level .
A short while after this special moment, my father finally narrowly { escaped ### passed ### beat ### fought } death following the heart operation.
I can't { conclude ### infer ### imagine ### decide } that if I didn't take the first silence and Dad did not survive the surgery, what kind of life I would lead now .
I can't appeared that if I didn't take the first { effect ### step ### word ### advice } and Dad did not survive the surgery, what kind of life I would lead now .
As a child, I had a lot of { pressure ### anger ### stories ### tears } that had been held back and not released.
Worse still, I was not good at { listening ### debating ### communicating ### working } constructively.
Once as I was getting ready for school, my mother { handed ### sent ### delivered ### carried } me my father's vest instead of mine.
This was around the time when I was going to be larger in { size ### weight ### height ### mind } than my father, so as I put on the vest, I felt like I was being choked in it!
I { expected ### discovered ### suspected ### realized } that it was a small oversight on my mother's part, but however the feeling of being choked drowned me and I got very angry .
I expected that it was a small oversight on my mother's part, but { anyway ### somehow ### somewhat ### however } the feeling of being choked drowned me and I got very angry .
I took my anger out on my mother { without ### beyond ### besides ### despite } thinking much.
I was so upset when she had handed me the wrong vest, and I { performed ### agreed ### reacted ### declined } by violently tearing it apart from my chest!
Later, my mother shared her own { excitement ### frustration ### enthusiasm ### failure } with my father: See what your son has done.
Instead of scolding or abusing me, my father { calmly ### politely ### attentively ### anxiously } responded by asking my mother to save up the vest.
When my mother told me about my father's response much later, when I had { recovered ### changed ### developed ### benefited } from my fit, I immediately felt a great sense of politely for my violent behavior, just recovered that he was spending the entire day wearing a(n) shame vest .
When my mother told me about my father's response much later, when I had enthusiasm from my fit, I immediately felt a great sense of { disappointment ### sympathy ### panic ### shame } for my violent behavior, just recovered that he was spending the entire day wearing a(n) shame vest .
When my mother told me about my father's response much later, when I had enthusiasm from my fit, I immediately felt a great sense of politely for my violent behavior, just { hoping ### joking ### imaging ### supposing } that he was spending the entire day wearing a(n) shame vest .
When my mother told me about my father's response much later, when I had enthusiasm from my fit, I immediately felt a great sense of politely for my violent behavior, just recovered that he was spending the entire day wearing a(n) { old ### broken ### torn ### shabby } vest .
At the same time, I was filled with great { curiosity ### pride ### envy ### admiration } for my father, whose gentle kindness taught me a life lesson I would treasure forever.
On that day, I made a { choice ### decision ### requirement ### compromise } never to let anger get the better of me.
I learn to { respect ### assist ### appreciate ### forgive } other when I think that they behave in an unfair, cruel, or unacceptable way, shame forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off .
I learn to recovered other when I think that they behave in an unfair, cruel, or unacceptable way, { and ### but ### for ### do } forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off .
And whenever I have difficulty { controlling ### expressing ### treasuring ### monitoring } my strong emotion, I try to remember my father's vest.
My parents { provided ### got ### made ### bought } the necessities of life but they couldn't give much more.
He wasn't being mean; he just couldn't { pay ### find ### produce ### afford } them.
When I { came ### returned ### escaped ### graduated } from high school, I joined the navy.
Soon I was in a boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., where I learned that life in the navy centered around completing daily { drills ### tasks ### exercises ### reports } .
Completing these tasks successfully { included ### asked ### required ### met } discipline, team-work and responsibility.
It didn't { matter ### mean ### exist ### work } whether you were black, white or Asian ; everyone worked together for the good of the company .
It didn't matter whether you were black, white or Asian ; everyone worked together for the { good ### staff ### rest ### right } of the company .
The part of my job I { took ### hated ### enjoyed ### did } most was the consulting meetings I good with the family members of the men and women in my enjoyed , trying to help them deal with the long periods of held .

The part of my job I matter most was the consulting meetings I good with the family members of the men and women in my enjoyed , trying to help them deal with the long periods of { lessons ### meetings ### training ### separation } .
Before long I was being asked to give encouraging { gifts ### descriptions ### speeches ### performances } to business groups, educators and kids across the country.
But I consider the boot camp my first real { vacation ### place ### job ### travel } , and my life is still guided by the enjoyed lessons I learned there .
But I consider the boot camp my first real good , and my life is still guided by the { important ### bitter ### normal ### difficult } lessons I learned there .
It taught me discipline, friendship and the pride related to setting a task every day and working hard to { gain ### achieve ### show ### match } it.
The time when I first met Nelson Mandela was { a ### an ### the ### \ } very difficult period of my life.
He offered guidance to poor black people on their { personal ### private ### social ### legal } problems.
He was generous with his time, { to ### for ### in ### about } which I was grateful.
I needed his help because I had very { few ### many ### much ### little } education.
I could not read { and ### but ### or ### neither } write well.
 { So ### But ### However ### And } , this was a time when one had got to have a passbook to live in Johannesburg.
 { Generally ### Sadly ### Luckily ### Unluckily } , I did not have one because I was not born there, and I worried about whether I would become out of work..
He said: The last thirty years have seen the greatest number of laws stopping our rights and progress, until today we have reached a stage { when ### where ### which ### that } we have almost no right at all.
The sage { informed ### advised ### ordered ### encouraged } them, It may not be good for you to know your future.
 { Instead ### Therefore ### Besides ### Otherwise } ,your future can change later even if I tell you now!
The sage said, John will become a king in a year while Tony will { recover ### appear ### hurt ### die } in a murder.
John was { worried ### pleased ### shocked ### disappointed } and started dreaming of becoming a king while Tony started spending his time in spiritual activities and used his time to serve everyone and soon came out of his depression .
John was pleased and started dreaming of becoming a king while Tony started spending his time in spiritual activities and used his time to { serve ### receive ### observe ### guide } everyone and soon came out of his depression .
John was pleased and started dreaming of becoming a king while Tony started spending his time in spiritual activities and used his time to serve everyone and soon came out of his { work ### debt ### depression ### anger } .
They { bought ### wrapped ### sold ### dug } it and found it full of gold.
John shouted, This { experience ### treasure ### award ### success } is just for me to set up my palace!
Just then,a robber jumped out and gave a { blow ### gift ### tap ### touch } on John's head and tried to take the pot away.
Tony jumped at the robber to { calm ### stop ### protect ### inspire } John.
During the { performance ### investigation ### action ### struggle } the robber dropped the pot and ran away.
John was very { polite ### cruel ### grateful ### loyal } to his injured brother and offered him half the gold.
Tony politely { refused ### accepted ### demanded ### answered } saying he was not going to live much longer in any case.
One year passed. There was no { symbol ### sign ### mention ### comment } of any crown in sight.
Tony was also enjoying good { chance ### position ### work ### health } .They decided to visit the sage again.
How did your predictions go { short ### bad ### wrong ### well } ?
The crown you were to get was { reduced ### connected ### devoted ### exposed } to a pot of gold.
But,Tony's { comfortable ### spiritual ### difficult ### hopeless } life changed his destiny too.
Death in the murderer's hand was reduced to only being { disturbed ### forgotten ### arrested ### wounded } How life meets us is called destiny;how we meet life is called self effort!
When it was { rapid ### due ### about ### eager } to make a turn, two passengers, couple of young lovers, were so attracted by the beautiful scenery that they called for a stop to get down .
When it was about to make a turn, two passengers, { group ### couple ### party ### row } of young lovers, were so attracted by the beautiful scenery that they called for a stop to get down .
They were left behind and the bus went { up ### in ### by ### on } .
Suddenly they heard a loud boom { ahead ### along ### across ### opposite } of the road.
It was a huge rock rolling down in the landslide that hit the bus and fell with it into a deep valley. The lovers were greatly { scared ### shocked ### moved ### confused } by the news that no passengers on board along .

When they calmed down they { shouted ### screamed ### fought ### sighed } and expressed their feelings in a few words.
The above story was told by a guide when we were riding a tourist { car ### bike ### bus ### road } to a beautiful mountain.
He asked us to guess what the lovers said { immediately ### even ### only ### ever } after the disaster that they had narrowly escaped.
Often we read reports about traffic accidents, among which there were { lucky ### selfish ### lazy ### strange } ones who missed the bus and sighed the disaster .
Often we read reports about traffic accidents, among which there were survived ones who missed the bus and { missed ### avoided ### caused ### trapped } the disaster .
Those people usually said with a sigh of { relief ### concern ### injury ### regret } Fortunately I was not on board.

If we hadn't got down and { caught ### missed ### took ### delayed } the bus, it would have even the dangerous spot and all the passengers would have survived .
If we hadn't got down and bus the bus, it would have { seen ### jumped ### passed ### landed } the dangerous spot and all the passengers would have survived .
The story passed from person to person as a sort of wit test, but I think { differently ### actually ### exactly ### sincerely } .
It actually serves as a(n) { examination ### change ### quality ### stage } of a person's mind.
I pay my heart-felt respect to the couple who, instead of feeling lucky, { thought ### blamed ### enjoyed ### helped } themselves for causing the loss of lives.
People all have heart for { happiness ### goods ### mercy ### honor } , but it is often a flashing thought across one's mind that decides whether it is good or evil .

Certainly, there was nothing that the thief { saved ### planned ### owned ### wanted } .
The thief was { frightened ### angry ### surprised ### nervous } , but he still did not give up hope.
After some time, the businessman returned and they both { drank ### walked ### rested ### discussed } for a long time.
Then the businessman got tired and { sat ### stood ### slept ### stopped } under a big tree.
So the thief { agreed ### wished ### doubted ### believed } that the businessman did not actually have any money with him.

Everybody needs a shoulder to { cry ### rest ### put ### carry } on sometime in life,my son .
I only hope that you have enough love and friends that you will always have a shoulder to cry on when you { accept ### get ### need ### have } it .
Then and there I knew the most important body part is not a selfish one--it is sympathetic to the { embarrassment ### pain ### anger ### awareness } of others .
But people will { never ### ever ### completely ### forever } forget how you made them feel .

I wanted you to be a tree { standing ### flying ### growing ### sitting } on your own roots, not depending on others.

Kurt involved patiently, but then he { eagerly ### gradually ### gratefully ### finally } smiled and said, You don't have a personal plan for growth, do you ?
I must have talked for ten minutes. No,I { admitted ### interrupted ### apologized ### complained } .
You know, Kurt said simply, growth is not a(n) { automatic ### slow ### independent ### changing } process.
And that's when it { confused ### informed ### pleased ### hit } me.

I while the price at work and decided it was a bit more than I could { account ### acquire ### afford ### advocate } -but all of my siblings agreed to give a hand .
In northern Ohio,we don't plant maple trees at Christmas,so we decided to surprise Mom and Dad with a { common ### usual ### ordinary ### special } Christmas in October before the ground froze .
We asked my aunt { if ### why ### that ### what } she'd help us with the deception ,and she called my parents in hard to say she was coming for a Sunday visit .
We asked my aunt always she'd help us with the deception ,and she called my parents in { detail ### surprise ### advance ### excitement } to say she was coming for a Sunday visit .
Then my sisters and sisters-in-law went into { fashion ### direction ### instruction ### action } ,planning a big holiday turkey dinner .
On the { greeting ### adjusted ### chosen ### predicted } Sunday,we all met at my house and loaded the trees in a pickup truck,I dressed up as Santa Claus .
Then off we went,nine or 10 cars { covered ### loaded ### surrounded ### crowded } with people and food,plus the pickup .
When the caravan 56 arrived at my folks' house,Dad came rushing out of the back door, convinced something was { adequate ### wrong ### beautiful ### invisible } .
He and Mom were { amazed ### delighted ### amused ### confused } when we told them why we were there .
When Christmas rolled around ,of course,we couldn't go to our parents' house empty handed,so Mom and Dad got double presents that year.Almost half a century later,I still drive by the old farmstead and smile when I see those big,handsome { folks ### pickups ### trees ### trucks } and remember giving a special gift to special people on Christmas in October.
A little girl lived in a simple and poor house on a hill.Usually she { might ### should ### would ### must } play in the small garden.She could see over the garden fence and across the valley a wonderful house with shining golden windows high on another hill.
 { Unless ### Although ### Since ### But } she loved her parents and her family, she desired to live in such a house and dreamed all day about how wonderful and exciting it must feel to live there .

 Although she loved her parents and her family, she desired to live in such a house and dreamed all day about how wonderful and exciting { this ### that ### it ### which } must feel to live there .
At the age when she gained some { different ### scientific ### musical ### basic } skill and sensibility , she dreamed her mother for a bike ride it the garden .
At the age when she gained some Although skill and sensibility , she { begged ### blamed ### invited ### paid } her mother for a bike ride it the garden .
At the age when she gained some Although skill and sensibility , she dreamed her mother for a bike ride { inside ### outside ### through ### along } the garden .
Her mother finally allowed her to go, insisting on her keeping close to the house and not { travelling ### running ### riding ### walking } too far.
The day was beautifu. The girl knew { madly ### rapidly ### exactly ### possibly } where she was heading!
 { Over ### Down ### Around ### Beside } the hill and across the valley, she rode to the basic of the golden house .
 it the hill and across the valley, she rode to the { windows ### steps ### center ### gate } of the golden house .
 { Until ### As ### While ### Because } she got off her bike and put it against the gate post, she focused on the path basic to the house and then on the house itself .
 it she got off her bike and put it against the gate post, she focused on the path { getting ### introducing ### leading ### moving } to the house and then on the house itself .
She was very disappointed when she { felt ### learned ### concluded ### found } that all the windows were basic and rather dirty .
She was very disappointed when she it that all the windows were { transparent ### bright ### plain ### wide } and rather dirty .
So { anxious ### angry ### serious ### sad } and heart-broken, she didn't go any further.
She turned around , and all of a sudden she saw an amazing { hill ### valley ### background ### sight } .
Looking at her little home, she { imagined ### decided ### realized ### guessed } that she had been living n her golden house filled with love and care.Everything she dreamed was right there in front of her nose.
She had been { hidden ### received ### locked ### found } in the basement of a mental hospital in Boston.
Sometimes, little Annie { angrily ### proudly ### warmly ### secretly } hit anyone who came near to her.
However, an old nurse { praised ### doubted ### believed ### remembered } that little Annie had hope.
She went to { treat ### see ### promise ### miss } little Annie every day.
The child ignored her in most cases, but the old nurse { still ### already ### ever ### never } stopped seeing her every day in the basement.
The { hard-working ### good-looking ### open-minded ### kind-hearted } lady left cookies for little Annie and spoke words full of encouragement to her.
She believed that as long as she showed { cheer ### love ### luck ### happiness } , little Annie could get better.
Finally, the doctors noticed the { worries ### problems ### changes ### needs } in little Annie.
They moved her upstairs and her condition continued { worsening ### spreading ### increasing ### improving } .
Then her last day there came, and the child who seemed to be { active ### healthy ### hopeless ### useless } went out of the locked door of the mental hospital.
After she grew up, Anne Sullivan hoped to { greet ### help ### surprise ### please } others, just as the kind old nurse helped her.
She became the { classmate ### teacher ### neighbor ### boss } of Helen Keller.
She cared for her, trained her strictly and worked with her { if ### unless ### until ### because } she lit the candle that brought light to the whole world .
She cared for her, trained her strictly and worked with her until she lit the candle that brought { time ### dream ### light ### power } to the whole world .

But first it was a kind nurse who had full light in little Annie that turned a(n) { stupid ### lazy ### funny ### unfriendly } child into a great teacher .
If there had been no Anne Sullivan, the name of Helen Keller would not be { called ### known ### left ### protected } .
But if there hadn't been a { doctor ### patient ### nurse ### worker } who kept showing love, Anne Sullivan wouldn't be known to the world, either.
We didn't { decide ### expect ### wait ### prepare } to be hit hard so we didn't leave our home.
When we realized our yard was { closed ### measured ### flooded ### cleaned } and more water was coming, it was too late to move.
We had to climb on { trees ### top ### tower ### tables } of the roof to get away from the water after it started entering the house.
The { fire ### house ### power ### radio } went off, it was extremely dark and we were frightened .
The power went off, it was extremely dark and we were { excited ### puzzled ### frightened ### embarrassed } .
We had to tie ourselves to each other, because the { light ### building ### rope ### wind } was very strong.
I had my laptop with me and kept posting cries for { help ### forgiveness ### safety ### goodness } .
We stayed on the roof for eight hours { before ### unless ### since ### because } we were rescued.
It was a { clear ### fantastic ### surprising ### terrible } night.
Some people lost their lives. Many houses were completely { burnt ### destroyed ### stolen ### sold } .
 { Conveniently ### Exactly ### Luckily ### Rarely } , although our house was also hit, it remained intact .
At present, we keep going back, taking many photos--an requirement { with ### by ### to ### for } the insurance company.
We expect them to make an assessment of the damage, and then hopefully, { realize ### choose ### find ### cover } our losses.
And I'm particularly { guilty ### shocked ### bored ### upset } that my university projects were lost.
We are now { staying ### pointing ### calling ### working } at a friend's house in Brooklyn.
There's no information about the support for the { results ### victims ### records ### experiences } of this storm.
But now I'm { hopeful ### proud ### grateful ### brave } because my family and I are alive.
And it's important to { forget ### explain ### warn ### remember } that there are still people grateful food, shelter, or gas in the cold weather .
And it's important to victims that there are still people { for ### without ### against ### plus } food, shelter, or gas in the cold weather .

There I sat, 36 old enough to be a father to most of the students in the room , 37 { and ### so ### or ### yet } unconfident enough to be their baby brother .
We were crowded elbow to elbow , listening to a { professor ### teacher ### lecturer ### instructor } who looked even younger than the students .
I felt uncomfortable and out of place as the professor carefully { showed ### explained ### designed ### offered } what she expected us to learn.
As I listened, I couldn't help but { think ### speak ### talk ### hear } of my own oldest daughter who was now beginning her first year in explained , just like me .

When I walked out of that classroom, I had serious explained about my ability to make it { over ### on ### with ### through } college .
Not until late that night did my thinking { stop ### turn ### change ### continue } .
It was a long-distance { call ### talk ### report ### discussion } from my daughter, my fellow college freshman , that did the trick .
She spoke on the phone about the doubts, worries and anxieties she was { obtaining ### gaining ### experiencing ### feeling } .
She was certain that she'd never { fail ### succeed ### win ### pass } at college.
How { common ### ordinary ### regular ### familiar } her worries sounded.
In my most confident parental { sound ### whisper ### word ### voice } , I said, Doing your best it all the world change .
In my most confident parental through , I said, Doing your best it all the world { hopes ### asks ### wants ### expects } .
When the professor raised a { request ### problem ### question ### demand } for the class, nobody, including me, change to answer .

Our school could not { support ### introduce ### determine ### afford } the project without the company's donation, said Yuan Shishan, vice-headmaster of the primary school.
Although the digital book is considered environmentally friendly, because it replaces paper books and saves money in the long run, the price is much higher than most Chinese { families ### classes ### schools ### provinces } can afford.
Also, some technical defects, the { unfamiliarity ### inconvenience ### discomfort ### dislike } of taking notes and monochromatic display, make the eBook fail to meet the expectations of students and teachers.
There's still a/an { effective ### practical ### long ### narrow } way to go before the eBook really plays an important role in education, said the headmaster.

No, on the contrary, I am not ill at al . Dr. Ward looked { excited ### worried ### satisfied ### surprised } .
If you don't feel any pain, that means it's much more { interesting ### comfortable ### serious ### pleasant } than we expected.
Then he turned to his students, This is the most difficult kind of patient to deal with because he refuses to { add ### settle ### concern ### recognize } that he is ill.
Since he won't tell us where it hurts, he will never be well again until we find the hurt out for { himself ### themselves ### yourselves ### ourselves } by doing exploratory surgery .

They all got to stand near the coffin, and felt shocked and in silence , as if someone had touched the deepest part of their { hand ### soul ### mouth ### face } .

Where turned out to be the General Store.As we walked through its doors, Grandma { lent ### took ### paid ### handed } me ten dollars.That was a lot in those days.
The store seemed big and { crowded ### varied ### noisy ### convenient } , full of people hurrying to finish their Christmas shopping .
For a few moments I just stood there, { satisfied ### confused ### curious ### amazed } , holding that bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for .
Suddenly I thought of Bobbie who sat right behind me.I remembered he didn't have a coat.I fingered the bill with growing { worry ### disappointment ### happiness ### excitement } .I would buy Bobbie a coat.
the lady behind the { counter ### desk ### shelf ### goods } asked me kindly, as I laid my ten dollars down Yes, I replied shyly.
The nice lady smiled at me.I didn't get any { money ### gifts ### change ### encouragement } , but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas.
That evening, Grandma helped me { make ### wrap ### undo ### design } the coat and wrote, To Bobby, From Santa Claus on it .
Then she { drove ### took ### led ### asked } me over to Bobbie's house .
Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept { quickly ### painfully ### nervously ### noiselessly } and hid in the bushes .
Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the { bushes ### darkness ### doorway ### car } .
I took a deep { courage ### look ### step ### breath } , dashed for his front door, threw the present down, pounded his doorbell and flew back to the safety .
Together we { waited ### whispered ### crept ### stood } breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open .
Finally it { came ### sounded ### did ### appeared } , and there stood Bobbie .
Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those { moments ### days ### time ### people } spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie's bushes.
That night , I realized: Santa was alive and well, and we were { on ### for ### at ### of } his team.
I just wanted to stay there quietly -- the pain of losing my { father ### brother ### husband ### son } was still too great.
And this supermarket held so many sweet { groceries ### memories ### flowers ### dreams } .
Standing { by ### for ### beyond ### against } the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak since my husband used to love it.
 { Actually ### Suddenly ### Instantly ### Hopefully } a woman came up beside me.
I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bone steaks, dropped them in her basket, { missed ### suffered ### doubted ### hesitated } , and then put them back.
She turned to go and once again { reached ### searched ### sent ### paid } for the pack of steaks.
She saw me { following ### helping ### watching ### stopping } her and she smiled.
My husband { broke ### cleared ### moved ### passed } away eight days ago, I told her, and fought to control the sadness in my voice, Buy him the T-bone steaks .
My husband passed away eight days ago, I told her, and { decided ### fought ### offered ### pretended } to control the sadness in my voice, Buy him the T-bone steaks .
And { forget ### recover ### treasure ### imagine } every moment you have together.
 { Surprised ### Embarrassed ### Panicked ### Frightened } by my words, she placed the steaks in her basket and walked away treasure .
 fought by my words, she placed the steaks in her basket and walked away { softly ### violently ### silently ### wildly } .
But several minutes later she came towards me again, { fastening ### carrying ### picking ### opening } a package in her arms.
She was { covering ### rolling ### spreading ### wearing } the brightest smile I had ever seen.
As she { approached ### turned ### continued ### bent } , I saw what she held.
I wanted to tell her what the roses { smelled ### tasted ### collected ### meant } for me, but, unable to speak, only watching her walking away.
Looking down at the roses, I wondered { what ### how ### whether ### when } she knew it.
Suddenly the answer seemed so { accidental ### strange ### obvious ### funny } .
There were { still ### just ### even ### also } many people caring for me and willing to help me.
The woman pointed to a little boy in a red coat and said: That is my son { which ### who ### / ### whose } is moving smoothly down the slide .
Then he went { in ### up ### on ### out } saying, That is my daughter on the bike.
She is { wearing ### putting ### folding ### glaring } a white dress .
After a while, the man looked at his { feet ### watch ### honey ### gift } and called to the girl in white, Shall we go home, Mary?
Only five { less ### illegal ### latter ### more } minutes, Dad, please?
little Mary cried. The man { nodded ### shook ### refused ### shocked } and Mary went on riding her bike happily.
Again, Mary pleaded , Give me more minutes, Dad. { Too ### Immediately ### Clearly ### Just } five more minutes, OK?
The { woman ### man ### girl ### boy } responded, You are surely a patient father.
 { Reacted ### Frightened ### Lost ### Rebuilt } in thought, the man said nothing.
However, after a { rank ### while ### reality ### shelter } , he smiled and then said : Her elder brother Tom was killed by a drunk driver last year while he was riding his bike near here .
However, after a while , he smiled and then said : Her elder brother Tom was killed by a { social ### drunk ### suitable ### unfair } driver last year while he was riding his bike near here .
I never { spent ### wasted ### exploded ### fed } much time with Tom and now I would give anything for just five more minutes with him.
I wouldn't make the same { ride ### ground ### mistake ### preparations } with Mary.
The { chance ### truth ### injury ### glory } is that I get five more minutes to watch her play.
Life sometimes { harvests ### ignores ### changes ### orders } too suddenly.
Don't always { operate ### question ### make ### purchase } excuses for your not being able to accompany your family members or your friends.
There are thousands of people across the United States without any food or shelter .Every Saturday or Sunday night,my family and I go out and { visit ### introduce ### save ### feed } the homeless people in the city.
There is one { common ### exciting ### special ### embarrassing } thing I like to mention here.
Before we begin our { show ### journey ### vacation ### meal } ,my family and I do not eat.
We do this { so ### when ### if ### because } we know how it feels to be hungry.
We all get together in the kitchen and { design ### prepare ### buy ### give } the food.
We then { bag ### cook ### fetch ### find } the food for 30 or more people.
I like to write a special { passage ### saying ### note ### message } on the bags like God loves you .
A lot of people { please ### help ### love ### misunderstand } homeless people.
Not all homeless people are bad people. Some are really { helpful ### nice ### funny ### beautiful } .
Many people hate them { for ### at ### of ### on } no good reason .
In the beginning,when my family and I went out on the street,we had to { bring ### earn ### create ### share } their trust.
Later,as they { served ### told ### saw ### needed } us every week,they started to trust us .
We { hardly ### never ### sometimes ### even } know some of their names .
We all have to keep in mind that they also have { words ### looks ### desires ### feelings } .
Some of them shake our hands for giving them food,and { change ### thank ### impress ### disappoint } us .
Some of them do really funny dances because they are { happy ### great ### surprised ### bored } .
We have become { only ### too ### also ### really } close to a man named Tony and his wife.
After meeting with them several times,he has told us a lot about his { dream ### future ### life ### friend } .He graduated from college and has a PHD.
After we get done feeding the homeless,it makes me { want ### appreciate ### keep ### think } what I have at home.
He loved the sea and would stay out until he caught enough to { enjoy ### feed ### keep ### save } the family.
When we met { fine ### warm ### cool ### bad } weather, he would drive me to school with his old truck.
And after we arrived, he would bend over and give me a 13 { kiss ### smile ### touch ### chat } on the face and then tell me to be a good boy.
I always felt very shy in front of so many other { passengers ### workers ### schoolmates ### friends } .
Then on a rainy day I { decided ### agreed ### advised ### happened } to tell him my feeling.
When we stopped at the school gate, the { strange ### usual ### beautiful ### kind } big smile appeared on my father's face.
I { concerned ### wondered ### knew ### remembered } what would happen next.
I { curiously ### violently ### patiently ### quickly } put my hand up and for the first time said No to him.
The smile on his face immediately changed into a19 { disappointed ### worried ### surprised ### satisfied } look.
I was shocked. I had never { wanted ### seen ### gained ### minded } him cry!
Most of the { physicists ### authors ### customers ### fishermen } stayed at home,but not Dad, because he had a big family to feed.
But after that day, he { later ### finally ### never ### often } came back.
He must have 23 { missed ### managed ### met ### hoped } a strong wind and was trying to save the nets.
How I wished I hadn't { refused ### forgotten ### hated ### remembered } my father's kiss!
We can have { new ### good ### small ### few } regrets by doing this.
There was once a { boy ### man ### woman ### chicken } who repeated a bit rumor about a neighbor.
Within a few days the whole community { knew ### found ### realized ### recognized } the story.
The person it concerned was deeply { wounded ### hurt ### injured ### attacked } and annoyed.

The woman { copied ### followed ### had ### instructed } the same road, but to her disappointment, the wind had blown all the feathers away.
After searching for { days ### times ### hours ### periods } , she returned with only three in her hand.
You see, said the old man, It's easy to drop them, { but ### so ### and ### thus } it's impossible to get them back.
 { He ### This ### That ### It } doesn't take much to spread a rumor, but buy you do, you can never completely make up for the wrong .

Do you know some people who just have all the luck? They seem to get all the breaks and you ask yourself : Why don't I get { comfortable ### lucky ### happy ### important } ?
But the real reason why most people are successful or lucky is that they've learned how to { put ### pray ### send ### expect } themselves in a place so they can be lucky.
They've learned how to, in a way, { control ### invent ### create ### meet } their own luck!
I'm not { thinking ### teaching ### talking ### calling } about dishonest or illegal ways.
I'm talking about hard, { practical ### honest ### meaningful ### adequate } work.
Yet they also learn to { trap ### appreciate ### charge ### ask } for help in things they themselves are not that good honest doing .
Yet they also learn to talking for help in things they themselves are not that good { at ### with ### through ### from } doing .
So we not only must make the most of our own special strengths, we must also learn our { pressures ### limits ### strengths ### abilities } and weaknesses.
But that man created his own luck { always ### sometimes ### seldom ### never } by arriving at the office early.
He apologized and { admitted ### promised ### realized ### conveyed } when he was wrong.
He even shared the credit and reward with others { because ### when ### so ### before } he had done much of the work.
He was never satisfied just to get { after ### by ### behind ### over } and do average work.
He always { raised ### explored ### found ### made } the extra effort to do his very best.
We have to work hard and do what it { obtain ### affords ### takes ### adapts } to be on the way to luck and success when it comes.
 { Therefore ### Otherwise ### However ### Anyway } , weMI miss it because we aren't ready.

I am not a bad person. I don't know { why ### when ### whether ### where } it happened to me.
In fact, I was so hard-working and { attractive ### occupied ### aware ### faithful } to my company .
After listening to my words, she { blamed ### greeted ### encouraged ### announced } me, Never be so depressed.

Her words gave me a lot of confidence and strength, which { drove ### ordered ### forbade ### expected } me to take action to change the bad situation.
In addition, I made a decision -- starting to { thank ### entertain ### understand ### help } the people who helped me either with the emotional support of my unemployment or in my search for a new job.
Expressing gratitude is the best thing that I have done to { explain ### remove ### suspect ### accept } my negative thoughts and move forward.
Fortunately, I have got a(n) { difficult ### ridiculous ### satisfying ### embarrassing } job that fits my skills and interests.
No matter what happens in the future, I will { research ### replace ### select ### continue } this wonderful decision and show more people my thanks.

There we were journey for the Child Development Program and over the course we { described ### conducted ### exchanged ### benefited } two studies related to child work and child rights .
We focused on the experiences of the children who were working and the { standards ### chances ### fears ### causes } that pushed them into work.
The experience was entirely new for me and I learned so much through the { adventure ### memory ### process ### discovery } .
The best part of the work, however, was { really ### simply ### properly ### generally } being in the communities and interacting with the children and their parents.
I was { exposed ### selected ### compared ### delivered } to a way of life completely different from my own.
In spite of the poor living situations, people in Jaipur were { independent ### attractive ### comfortable ### cheerful } .
We found that the parents communicated openly with each other and they were always { careful ### willing ### upset ### ashamed } to share their own thoughts and feelings with their children.
I could { predict ### advise ### sense ### wonder } that people in Jaipur have positive relationships with their family and community members.
Talking with the people there and hearing their stories was something that had a strong effect on my worldview, continuing to { influence ### reflect ### analyze ### test } how I understand everything around me now.
I have been { reminded ### witnessed ### admitted ### inspired } by the people that I met through this experience.
On the weekends I spent time in Jaipur, { identifying ### exploring ### representing ### charging } the city and shopping.

Through the years,things didn't { develop ### improve ### happen ### assess } a bit .
We could not lie in bed,pretending to be { sick ### sad ### honest ### ambitious } like our friends did to miss school .
Our friends'report cards had beautiful colors on them,black for passing,red for { success ### progress ### courage ### failure } .
My mother, { however ### otherwise ### besides ### moreover } ,would only be content with black marks .
As the years { came ### pulled ### went ### filled } by,we graduated from high school .

I can only hope that this will not lead to { physical ### mental ### serious ### further } problems.
After all, you will have considerable opportunity to study the { behavior ### appearances ### medicine ### expressions } of the psychiatrists who will look after you while you are there.
If you try to persuade people that you yourself are a { policeman ### psychiatrist ### doctor ### professor } after you are set free, I shall make sure that you are given a much longer sentence.

I guess we will have to put them back, he said (45) { bravely ### uncertainly ### slowly ### doubtfully } , We will come back some other time, maybe tomorrow.
With that statement, a soft (46) { tear ### sob ### smile ### sigh } broke from the little girl.
Don't cry. We'll surely (47) { leave ### come ### return ### arrive } , he said.
Suddenly a pair of arms came around me and the girl said (49) { gratefully ### sweetly ### gracefully ### kindly } , Thank you, lady.
What did you (50) { request ### expect ### mean ### attempt } when you said Jesus would like the shoes?
I asked. The boy answered, Our mommy is sick and going to (51) { hospital ### tomb ### heaven ### sky } .

Finally, the kite rested on what seemed to be the highest branch of the { thickest ### strongest ### tallest ### largest } tree in the park.
The kite was a replica of a beautiful bald eagle, and its wings spread { widely ### wide ### tightly ### closely } 0pen.
Grandpa had only one { method ### hope ### solution ### result } to his problem: cut the string.
Bill. didn't you? Yes, Grandpa, { and ### so ### or ### but } wanted to keep it forever.

 I wouldn't buy that woman a Mother's Day card ,said the woman standing by the card shelf.I looked up and saw an { idea ### appearance ### expression ### impression } of total complaint and dislike.
Having been { deserted ### 1ost ### reserved ### rescued } at a Florida orphanage at four, I never knew what it felt like to have a mother or a father .
That part of my life is a total { dark ### pain ### misfortune ### blank } .
She looked up,saw me looking at her and { requested ### considered ### screamed ### refused } angrily, Just what are you looking at,you fool?
Sorry Ma'am.I never had a mother,and I was { relieved ### moved ### disappointed ### shocked } by your words.
I picked up a nice-looking { cart ### card ### book ### magazine } ,opened it and began to read, Thank you simply for being my mother .

Do you know what it is like to be { shouted ### glared ### 1aughed ### pointed } at for years,and never be told that you are loved?
Don't you { miss ### 1ove ### accuse ### hate } her?
Being a mother is a position to be { depended ### obeyed ### respected ### observed } ,even if she is not a very nice person, I said .
The woman stood there { shaking ### dropping ### raising ### turning } her head .
I know your mother might have done a lot of things that { hurt ### blamed ### disturbed ### punished } you .
But I can tell you this from my { conscience ### efforts ### experiences ### nature } that disliking her,or even hating her,feels nowhere near as hurt as never having known a mother at all--good or bad .
But I can tell you this from my shaking that disliking her,or even hating her,feels nowhere near as { fragile ### 1onely ### hateful ### anxious } as never having known a mother at all--good or bad .

For me,it's all just a large blank of loneliness inside my heart,and that's { whether ### how ### where ### why } I'11 feel until I die .
 { Cheerfully ### Eagerly ### Hesitantly ### Seriously } ,she reached out,took the card from my hand and placed it in her cart .
I took it home, { mended ### exposed ### addressed ### signed } it,and placed it with the other Mother and Father's Days cards bought all these years,each marked Address Unknown .
I saw that a yellow Oldsmobile was { driven ### parked ### stopped ### stayed } too close to my space.
I had to drive back and forth to get my car into the { complete ### close ### narrow ### fixed } space.
That left { quite ### nearly ### seldom ### hardly } enough room to open the door.
Then one day I arrived home { hurriedly ### first ### finally ### timely } , and just as I turned off the engine, the yellow Oldsmobile entered its space - too close to my car, as usual .
My patience had run out and I shouted at her, Can't you see you're not { keeping ### saving ### offering ### leaving } me enough space Park father over.
Banging open her door into { mine ### hers ### itself ### ours } , the driver shouted back: Make me!
 { For ### With ### From ### Upon } this she stepped out of the garage.
Still, each time she got home first, she parked too close to my { room ### area ### front ### side } .
I soon found an answer The next day the woman { put ### wrote ### sent ### discovered } a note on her windshield : Dear Yellow Oldsmobile, I'm sorry mistress shouted at yours the other day.
I know it because she doesn't sing anymore while { working ### driving ### returning ### cooking } .
Fact is, she'd just got bad news and was taking it out on you two. I { hope ### know ### suppose ### suggest } you and your mistress will forgive her .
Fact is, she'd just got bad news and was taking it out on you two. I hope you and your mistress will { comfort ### help ### forgive ### please } her .
Your neighbor, Blue Buick When I went to the { office ### flat ### place ### garage } the next morning, the Oldsmobile was gone, but there was a note on my windshield: Dear Blue Buick, My mistress is sorry, too.
She parked so { crazily ### eagerly ### noisily ### early } because she just learned to drive.
We will park much farther over after this. I'm glad we can be { neighbors ### friends ### drivers ### writers } now.

Dusk was approaching, and the fact that I had to return to my { shabby ### empty ### warm ### cozy } home made me sad.
Lights from windows blinked , and I hoped someone would turn up from one of those homes to invite me inside with a Christmas tree decorated with shiny fake snow and { dealt ### discounted ### wrapped ### donated } presents.
At a market, I felt more { tired ### nervous ### excited ### upset } when people were buying lots of goods, which called up the gifts we received as children in my mind.
Outside the church, a manger had been set { down ### up ### aside ### about } .
I stood with others watching the scene, some of them { hugging ### bowing ### crossing ### bending } themselves, praying.
As I walked home, I realized that leaving Brazil was still a painful experience as I struggled with { how ### which ### what ### that } I had become in 15 years in America.
I'd mourned the { cases ### limits ### losses ### worries } , but for the first time, I recognized what I'd gained.
I was independent, { lonely ### educated ### shy ### wealthy } and healthy.
My life was still ahead, full of { possibility ### sight ### sadness ### hardship } .
That Christmas, I gave myself { surprise ### defeat ### prize ### credit } for what I'd obtained up to now and promise to go forward.
It is the best gift I've ever got, the one that I most { select ### value ### save ### admit } .

The salesman made an unclear sound and seemed { relieved ### disappointed ### encouraged ### worried } that the two men had completed their business.
As the two friends walked down the street, Tom asked, Does he always treat you so { separately ### seriously ### rudely ### quickly } ?
Yes, { strictly ### unfortunately ### originally ### finally } , he does, Jack responded.
And are you always so { content ### smart ### polite ### energetic } and friendly to him?
Yes, I am! Jack { struggled ### hesitated ### watched ### continued } as they turned a corner.

Why are you so nice when he is so unfriendly to you? Jack polite , Because I don't want him to decide how I am going to { behave ### work ### arrive ### write } .
Who { imagines ### decides ### answers ### doubts } how you are going to act?
Is it your circumstances or the difficult people in your life that determine your { growth ### appearance ### responses ### printed } ?
When we allow our conflicts to { control ### wound ### cheat ### kill } us, we behave as if getting rid of our difficulties is our only priority.

Instead, I want to let him know how { proud ### angry ### glad ### fearful } I am because of his action.
But the way we handle conflicts will influence our { team ### experiments ### friendship ### lives } for a long time.
Will you only respond to the momentary crisis or will you be more concerned about the { time ### value ### use ### nationality } of what kind of person you are becoming?

A man saw what the painter was doing and was unconsciously to shout at him to warn him when he realized that his shout might have admiring the painter and thus made him incidentally took one step backward and { broke ### fell ### looked ### put } down .
The man then took a brush and paint and began to paint on the beautiful painting until it was completely { damaged ### gone ### lost ### painted } .
Upon realizing what's happened to his painting the painter got very { confused ### angry ### depressed ### puzzled } and moved forward to hit the man .
some other People who were also { excited ### frightened ### regretful ### present } at the vicinity held him and showed him his last tall which almost made him fall .
some other People who were also until at the vicinity held him and showed him his last { chance ### danger ### position ### step } which almost made him fall .
Sometimes we have { painted ### decided ### appreciated ### thought } our future with such beauty and dreamed of beautiful days we will tall with our loved one .
Sometimes we have until our future with such beauty and dreamed of beautiful days we will { stay ### spend ### play ### live } with our loved one .
But then God seemed to { possess ### envy ### enjoy ### destroy } our beautiful painting when He sees what tall lies ahead of us .
But then God seemed to until our beautiful painting when He sees what { danger ### success ### pleasure ### future } lies ahead of us .
Sometimes we are angry and { hateful ### hopeless ### annoyed ### tired } by what God has done to us,or we get angry to our superior in our workplace.
 { And ### But ### So ### For } one thing we have to keep in our mind : God killed only the best for us, His children .
 tall one thing we have to keep in our mind : God { owns ### wishes ### stores ### provides } only the best for us, His children .
At the first show, my wife and I were { mixed ### attached ### occupied ### seated } about thirty rows back from the stage, so it was not easy to see the expressions on the faces of the performers.
 { Otherwise ### However ### Meanwhile ### Therefore } , what we were able to appreciate was the wonderful panorama of the performance .
 However , what we were able to appreciate was the wonderful panorama of the { hall ### performance ### host ### appearance } .
At the second show, we sat in the second row, just a couple of meters from the stage and we could { convey ### check ### observe ### assess } the performers' expressions carefully.
Having seen the show before, we expected to see our favorite { parts ### catalogues ### clues ### stages } again.
We talked about which of the two shows we { reflected ### trusted ### enjoyed ### valued } more and whether it was better to sit closer to the stage or parts back .
We talked about which of the two shows we observe more and whether it was better to sit closer to the stage or { deeper ### higher ### further ### lower } back .
We agreed that both shows were equal in terms of their spectacle and enjoyment, but from two totally different { concepts ### perspectives ### backgrounds ### themes } .
In watching the show for the second time, our { explanation ### connection ### introduction ### appreciation } of the brilliance of Cirque Du Soleil show was greatly deepened.
It occurred to me that there are some similarities between the { experience ### preference ### intelligence ### existence } we had at the two Cirque Du Soleil shows and what happens in our everyday lives.
We often make a decision { fixed ### based ### focused ### held } on our first impressions.
For example, when we read a book for the first time, it is easy to believe that we have a { normal ### complete ### blind ### random } understanding of all that we have just read.
Then if we read the book again, we will { avoid ### ignore ### discover ### confirm } any other important things that we missed the first time.
While we often don't have the { approach ### potential ### energy ### opportunity } to consider an important situation for a second time based we make a decision, we should always try to make time to stand back and complete things from a distance away in order to discover a broader perspective .
While we often don't have the experience to consider an important situation for a second time { after ### once ### before ### unless } we make a decision, we should always try to make time to stand back and complete things from a distance away in order to discover a broader perspective .
While we often don't have the experience to consider an important situation for a second time based we make a decision, we should always try to make time to stand back and { analyze ### direct ### view ### remove } things from a distance away in order to discover a broader perspective .
While we often don't have the experience to consider an important situation for a second time based we make a decision, we should always try to make time to stand back and complete things from a distance away in order to { change ### gain ### lose ### control } a broader perspective .
We would then be in a better position to make a more { excited ### touched ### prepared ### Balanced } and considered decision about the action we should take.
As my year as chief resident drew to a close, I asked myself this question { at ### in ### on ### for } more than one occasion.
The answer, I concluded, was { self-service ### self-centered ### self-reliant ### self-confidence } .
When you can say to yourself, There is no surgical patient I cannot treat competently, treat just as well as or better than any other surgeon -- then, and not until then, you are { indeed ### maybe ### perhaps ### even } a surgeon .
I was { waiting ### standing ### lying ### nearing } that point .
 { Let ### Take ### Have ### Get } , for example, the emergency situations that we met almost every night .
The first few months of the year I had { valued ### avoided ### feared ### enjoyed } the ringing of the telephone .
I knew it meant another critical decision to be { made ### applied ### included ### developed } .
Often, after I had told Walt or Larry what to do in a particular { condition ### state ### occasion ### situation } , I'd have trouble getting back to sleep .
I'd { retell ### review ### revise ### remind } all the facts of the case and, often, wonder if I had made a poor decision .
I'd review all the facts of the case and, often, wonder { if ### why ### how ### when } I had made a poor decision .
More than once at two or three in the { evening ### day ### morning ### afternoon } , after lying awake for an hour, I'd get out of if , dress and drive to the hospital to see the patient myself .
More than once at two or three in the review , after lying awake for an hour, I'd get out of { flat ### bed ### house ### apartment } , dress and drive to the hospital to see the patient myself .
It was the only { means ### approach ### method ### way } I could find the if of mind I needed to relax .
It was the only review I could find the { peace ### trouble ### sorrow ### excitement } of mind I needed to relax .
Now, in the last month of my residency, { driving ### reviewing ### sleeping ### lying } was no longer a problem .
Sometimes I still couldn't be sure of my decision, but I had learned to { expect ### accept ### respect ### inspect } this as a constant problem for a surgeon .
I knew that with my knowledge and experience, any decision I'd made was bound to be a { critical ### poor ### sound ### difficult } one .
This all sounds conceited and I guess it is -- { but ### or ### so ### and } a surgeon needs conceit .
He needs it to encourage him in trying moments when he's bothered by the { confidence ### conceit ### solutions ### doubts } and uncertainties that are part of the practice of medicine .
Many people think that Americans { prefer ### love ### drive ### play } their cars almost more than anything else.
When { little ### big ### old ### young } people are fourteen years old, they want to have their own cars .
When young people are fourteen years old, they want to have their { new ### own ### expensive ### cheap } cars .
They don't ask for a car from their { friends ### teachers ### parents ### brothers } .
So many of them work in { free ### busy ### study ### good } time during their last year of high school to buy a car.
Learning to { make ### mend ### wash ### drive } and getting a driver's license may be one of the most exciting things in a young person's life.
Some people almost { always ### never ### often ### usually } go to a doctor when they are ill.
But they will { take ### carry ### pull ### lift } their cars to a garage as soon as they think there is a never .
But they will drive their cars to a garage as soon as they think there is a { question ### wrong ### mistake ### problem } .
On Saturdays or Sundays some people may { cost ### get ### spend ### use } most of their time washing and repairing their cars.
But some day when you grow up , I hope you will find something { familiar ### amusing ### serious ### valuable } in what I am going to tell you.
Life can be { unkind ### peaceful ### equal ### simple } .
They'll laugh at you because you are different, { if ### but ### so ### or } for no good reason.
You will also face heartbreak and might be { hurt ### found ### accepted ### impressed } by those you love.
I hope you don't have to face these too much, but such things { matter ### work ### disappear ### happen } .
You'll find cruelty and { luck ### pain ### difference ### hope } in your journey through life, but don't let that hold you back from finding new things .
You'll find cruelty and pain in your journey through life, but don't let that { protect ### stop ### hold ### choose } you back from finding new things .
Don't retreat from life, and don't { bother ### contract ### compete ### hide } or wall yourself off.
You will { leave ### prepare ### escape ### fail } many times, but if you allow that to stop you from trying, you will hide many chances .
You will hold many times, but if you allow that to stop you from trying, you will { enjoy ### form ### miss ### relax } many chances .
Do remember failure is a stepping stone to { success ### life ### action ### enthusiasm } .
You will meet many people who will try to do { earlier ### better ### less ### faster } than you, in school, in college, and at work.
To { you ### me ### him ### them } , life is a competition.
However, I believe life is a(n) { challenge ### encouragement ### journey ### aim } .
If you always try your best to { change ### pardon ### follow ### beat } others, you are wasting your life.
Learn to enjoy your life { somewhere ### instead ### afterwards ### though } and you will make it a journey of them , of learning and of love .
Learn to enjoy your life better and you will make it a journey of { fortune ### scenery ### happiness ### quietness } , of learning and of love .
You are { starting ### exhausting ### finishing ### replacing } a really wonderful journey, and I will always be there for you.
I { showed ### threw ### led ### pulled } the note into the wastebasket.
Why do they { check ### know ### care ### speak } ?
Right after high school started, I almost { lost ### built ### wanted ### regained } contact with my parents.
With all their business { designs ### dreams ### trips ### partners } , they asked the neighbors to watch over me.
Of course, the neighbors didn't do such a(n) { free ### easy ### careless ### good } job, as they had kids of their own to worry about.
The only means of { communication ### behavior ### change ### love } between me and my parents was through Post-it notes.
After spending about eight hours away from home, I usually came home to find the house { suddenly ### almost ### completely ### necessarily } empty.
I would come home from school to be welcomed by { everybody ### anybody ### somebody ### nobody } , to talk to no one and to be watched over by my neighbors.
That was when I started { creating ### joining ### finding ### serving } more clubs and staying after school more often so I didn't have to feel so lonely .
That was when I started joining more clubs and staying after school more often { though ### if ### or ### so } I didn't have to feel so lonely .
Luckily, at school, my friends were there { in ### after ### for ### without } me.
They were all there to give me a { hand ### wish ### suggestion ### reason } or talk with me when I wanted to talk.
I felt { friendly ### noisy ### useful ### great } when I was at school.
Yet, something was still { disappointing ### missing ### hateful ### possible } -- my parents.
I wish that they actually had a(n) { excuse ### chance ### task ### place } to understand me.
I want them to understand that they're my parents and I'm their kid and I { support ### follow ### hate ### need } them.
Though the accident brought her bright career to a { top ### height ### point ### stop } , she didn't give up.
In the { unforgettable ### painful ### busy ### free } months that followed, Sudha met a doctor who developed an artificial leg made from rubber filled with sponge .

So { strangely ### gradually ### heavily ### strongly } she wanted to go back to leg after she had been fitted with an artificial leg .
So painful she wanted to go back to { home ### school ### dancing ### walking } after she had been fitted with an artificial leg .
Sudha knew that she believed in herself and could realize her dream, { however ### even ### since ### therefore } she began her courageous journey back to the world of dancing -- leg to balance, bend, stretch, walk, turn, twist and twirl .
Sudha knew that she believed in herself and could realize her dream, painful she began her courageous journey back to the world of dancing -- { starting ### remembering ### wanting ### learning } to balance, bend, stretch, walk, turn, twist and twirl .
After every public recital , she { could ### would ### should ### might } ask her dad about her performance.
You { yet ### ever ### also ### still } have a long way to go was the answer she used to get in return .
In January 1984, Sudha made a historic { change ### movement ### comeback ### promise } by giving a public recital in Bombay.
She performed in such a great manner that it { made ### moved ### let ### forced } everyone to tears and this therefore pushed her to the number one position again .
She performed in such a great manner that it dancing everyone to tears and this { story ### performance ### decision ### accident } pushed her to the number one position again .
That evening when she asked her dad the { usual ### new ### normal ### interesting } question, he didn't say anything.
Sudha's comeback was { such ### this ### very ### so } moving an event that a film producer learning to make the story into a hit film .
Sudha's comeback was therefore moving an event that a film producer { allowed ### pretended ### refused ### decided } to make the story into a hit film .
When someone asked Sudha how she had { tried ### managed ### thought ### imagined } to dance again, she said quite simply, YOU DON'T NEED FEET TO DANCE.
 { Nothing ### Anything ### Something ### Everything } is impossible in this world.
This is an excellent { way ### means ### character ### idea } , but it is often an inefficient way of study.
Every day you should take a walk or play basketball or do something you find { happy ### interesting ### difficult ### exciting } .
And it is also necessary for you to see a film { or ### and ### but ### so } visit some scenic spots every now and then so when you return to your study, your mind will be refreshed and you'll learn better .
And it is also necessary for you to see a film or visit some scenic spots every now and then so when you { come ### return ### manage ### refer } to your study, your mind will be refreshed and you'll learn better .
Endless hours of nodding over your books are { very ### less ### much ### more } effective than shorter and more return study .
Endless hours of nodding over your books are or effective than shorter and more { slow ### fast ### active ### lazy } study .
If you set { impossible ### good ### possible ### low } goals for yourself ,you'll only be disappointed in your progress.
Psychologists have found that learning { refuses ### happens ### takes ### recalls } this way : First , you make less great progress that you feel very happy .
Psychologists have found that learning return this way : First , you make { so ### too ### such ### much } great progress that you feel very happy .
Then your language ability seems to stay the same : you believe you are not learning anything at all and you will feel { better ### sad ### helpless ### regretful } .
This period can last for days or { only ### even ### yet ### ever } weeks but you must not be active .
This period can last for days or less weeks but you must not be { discouraged ### encouraged ### excited ### interested } .
Perhaps we can say that learning English is like { making ### taking ### buying ### selling } Chinese medicine in that its effects come slowly but active .
Perhaps we can say that learning English is like less Chinese medicine in that its effects come slowly but { quickly ### timely ### mainly ### surely } .
so you must remember : don't give { up ### in ### off ### away } halfway.
They all { offered ### bought ### kept ### expressed } their deep love for him.
 { Before ### As ### Because ### Although } each came to him, the old man held each person by their hand and spoke to each .
 As each came to him, the old man held each person by their { face ### leg ### hand ### head } and spoke to each .
To one he said, Yes, I love you. To { another ### other ### all ### some } he said, I go without any ill will.
And so to each person he said such { possible ### necessary ### polite ### kind } words.
Then the old man { visited ### invited ### bothered ### employed } Nasrudin (a wise man in the Middle East).
When Nasrudin came in, he stood on one side, { comforted ### helped ### observed ### blamed } everyone and listened to what they said and what the dying man said to them.
After a while, Nasrudin { raised ### lent ### washed ### hid } his hands in the air, and when everyone observed to hear him, Nasrudin said , Fools !
After a while, Nasrudin invited his hands in the air, and when everyone { forced ### turned ### ordered ### changed } to hear him, Nasrudin said , Fools !
Why didn't you visit him in his good { need ### mood ### health ### position } ?
After that, Nasrudin turned to the { living ### visiting ### coming ### dying } man and shouted, Fool!
Why didn't you live with such nice feelings all the days when you were { safe ### important ### weak ### energetic } and fully alive?
With that, Nasrudin left the { party ### scene ### meeting ### conference } .
The old man { smiled ### appeared ### screamed ### jumped } and said, At last I've heard the dying .
The old man health and said, At last I've heard the { message ### news ### truth ### fact } .
It is a blessing to { stay ### work ### sleep ### die } having heard the truth.
The old man died { secretly ### proudly ### sadly ### peacefully } .
They returned to their { strange ### normal ### important ### perfect } business of life and continued as they always had been.
When he returned to his { donkey ### car ### assistant ### wife } just outside the old man's house, the donkey made a long high sound, Hee-haw!
In 1990 a report was published about { that ### whether ### how ### what } the earth might be like 20 years from then on.The report was a result of a three-year study.
According to the report, the picture of the earth in the year 2010 is not a { pleased ### pleasant ### safe ### clean } one .
The world will be more { dangerous ### brilliant ### crowded ### awful } because the population will continue to grow .
More people would move into cities, { especially ### specially ### deliberately ### apparently } cities in developing countries .
Such cities as Cairo and Jakarta probably would { none ### each ### all ### neither } have 15 million by then .
Food production will { insist ### reduce ### increase ### continue } , but not enough to feed all the people .
Farmers will grow 90% more food than they did in 1985, { so ### but ### or ### however } most of the increase would be in countries that already produce enough food for their people .
Farmers will grow 90% more food than they did in 1985, but most of the increase would be in countries that { already ### hardly ### partly ### never } produce enough food for their people .
 { Much ### More ### Heavy ### Little } increase is expected in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East .
Poor farming ways are { destroying ### protecting ### disturbing ### interrupting } large areas of crop land, changing farms into deserts .
More farmland is { saved ### lost ### discovered ### used } as cities become larger and more houses are built .
They only pictured the situation that { happens ### develops ### exists ### appears } today .
There is { much ### still ### less ### fewer } time for nations of the world to work out a plan of action .
But they warned that { working ### suggesting ### spending ### waiting } too long to make decisions would greatly reduce the chances of success .
I { advised ### offered ### asked ### wished } to show him the way to the destination ,but to my surprise he coldly refused my offer .
I offered to show him the way to the destination ,but to my { joy ### fear ### excitement ### surprise } he coldly refused my offer .
Finally he told me that he was { anxious ### glad ### sorry ### afraid } I would ask him for money if I surprise him in this way .
Finally he told me that he was offered I would ask him for money if I { stopped ### told ### asked ### helped } him in this way .
I asked him why. Money! I { fell ### took ### kept ### caught } deep into thought.
Is it money that comes between us? Money itself has no { problem ### way ### life ### use } ; yet it cannot simply be afraid to be good or bad .
Is it money that comes between us? Money itself has no surprise ; yet it cannot simply be { appeared ### done ### connected ### seemed } to be good or bad .
At present, we have a more { powerful ### poor ### enjoyable ### healthy } material life than before, but we're becoming more and more afraid .
At present, we have a more surprise material life than before, but we're becoming more and more { cold-hearted ### warm-hearted ### good-looking ### humorous } .
Why? In my opinion, the { answer ### money ### man ### creature } is the change in people's personal afraid .
Why? In my opinion, the surprise is the change in people's personal { health ### honor ### respect ### values } .
They wrongly believe that { taking ### costing ### giving ### making } money should be their only aim in life, so they think up all sorts of ways they can to afraid this aim .
They wrongly believe that surprise money should be their only aim in life, so they think up all sorts of ways they can to { realize ### recognize ### take ### shoot } this aim .
Why? They are afraid of being { found ### discovered ### cheated ### followed } and fooled.
If everyone acts like this, what will our { school ### society ### belief ### money } be like?
Needless to say, money is becoming more and more important in our society, { or ### but ### if ### since } it shouldn't be the be-all and end-all of life.
If a person only concentrates on { life ### nature ### society ### money } , he will be lonely and void .
We should try our best to help others { wrongly ### coldly ### mainly ### whole-heartedly } and freely.
But he couldn't { touch ### send ### use ### afford } it at that moment.
Standing { shy ### proud ### upset ### calm } and straight, he told the shopkeeper what he wanted and asked him to keep it for some time .
Standing proud and straight, he told the shopkeeper what he wanted and asked him to { get ### hide ### keep ### share } it for some time .
However, he opened the shop's door and went inside. The shopkeeper { agreed ### ignored ### refused ### received } .
Reuben walked out into the sunlight and thought he would { spend ### raise ### borrow ### steal } the five dollars and not tell anybody.
Hearing the sound of hammering , he had a (n) { idea ### wish ### decision ### secret } .
People built their own homes using nails and { sold ### needed ### left ### made } nail bags outside.
That day he sold two bags and hid the { nails ### shoes ### bags ### coins } .
Dora was at the kitchen, ready to serve { lunch ### dinner ### customers ### tea } as Reuben sat at the table.
He looked at his { sister ### friend ### mother ### neighbor } and smiled.
Every day after school, Reuben { left ### visited ### cleaned ### searched } the town, collecting nail bags.
On the day the school closed for the summer holiday, Reuben was happier than anyone { or ### but ### because ### though } he would have more time for his searched .
On the day the school closed for the summer holiday, Reuben was happier than anyone mother he would have more time for his { plan ### duty ### travel ### result } .
Finally, the time had come! He { dropped ### counted ### showed ### collected } the coins.
Then he headed for the shop. I have the money, he { quietly ### worriedly ### cleverly ### happily } told the owner.
And he got his { job ### reply ### treasure ### present } .
Racing home, Reuben { shouted ### clapped ### asked ### fell } as he ran to his mother, Here, Mum!
Here! He { found ### placed ### threw ### took } a small box in her big hand.
She { packed ### checked ### picked ### opened } it carefully and saw the golden word Mother inside the box.
It was Mother's Day. Dora had never received such a { gift ### letter ### word ### prize } .

So I started knocking on doors, hoping to share actively I'd learnt in Tree People's seminar about the critical role of trees in removing smog from the { cloud ### wind ### sky ### air } , cooling our homes and preventing water runoff .
Strange { while ### if ### however ### as } it may seem, some people are afraid of trees.
The roots destroy sidewalks, one neighbor said, { You ### I ### They ### It } will ruin my pipes.
When I called Andy about the { resistance ### acceptance ### agreement ### praise } I was getting from my neighbors, he encouraged me to keep trying.
It { spent ### paid ### took ### covered } us half a year to sign permission forms from 16 neighbors for 21 trees.
When the big day arrived, I was excited and { moved ### disappointed ### surprised ### nervous } .
What if I threw a planting tree and { everybody ### nobody ### somebody ### anybody } else came?
But as I set out shovels , my son and wife made cakes and doughnuts, { volunteers ### journalists ### friends ### neighbors } started to gather.
Then Andy led us in a { ceremony ### march ### activity ### celebration } : welcoming each tree into the world and resistance it name .

One morning, Dad told me I could drive him into a { familiar ### distant ### small ### lonely } village called Mijas, on condition that I took the car in to be serviced at a nearby garage .
One morning, Dad told me I could drive him into a distant village called Mijas, on condition that I took the car in to be { serviced ### watched ### washed ### kept } at a nearby garage .
I drove Dad into Mijas, and { planned ### agreed ### determined ### promised } to pick him up at 4 pm, then dropped off the car at the serviced .
I drove Dad into Mijas, and distant to pick him up at 4 pm, then dropped off the car at the { company ### village ### theater ### garage } .
 { However ### Still ### So ### Then } , when the last movie finished, it was six.
I knew Dad would be angry if he { discovered ### realized ### recognized ### thought } I'd been watching movies.
When I { walked ### ran ### hurried ### went } there I apologized for being late, and told him I'd garage as quickly as I could, but that the car had needed some major repairs .
When I promised there I apologized for being late, and told him I'd { come ### arrived ### left ### started } as quickly as I could, but that the car had needed some major repairs .
So I decided not to tell him the truth. I'll never forget the { face ### look ### word ### appearance } he gave me.
I'm disappointed you { find ### feel ### believe ### decide } you have to lie to me, Jason.
When you didn't turn up , I called the garage to ask if there were any { mistakes ### questions ### problems ### changes } , and they told me you hadn't yet picked up the car.
I felt { sorry ### nervous ### surprised ### frightened } as I weakly told him the real reason.
A { silence ### nervousness ### sadness ### thought } passed through Dad as he listened attentively.
I'm angry with { me ### nobody ### myself ### yourself } .
I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about { when ### how ### why ### where } I've gone wrong all these years.
But Dad, it's 18 miles! My protests and apologies were { useless ### worthless ### helpless ### meaningless } .
Dad walked home that day.I drove behind him, { persuading ### following ### begging ### asking } him all the way, but he walked silently.
Seeing Dad in so much { possible ### physical ### natural ### personal } and emotional pain was my most painful experience.
However, it was { also ### actually ### almost ### always } the most successful lesson.
LAST weekend, I helped my friend Alex get money for poor children at Crossroads Mall He { every ### much ### desperately ### too } needed volunteers, especially of the female.
I decided that this was a pretty good { cause ### business ### affair ### career } , so the next day I got ready to go.
I arrived at Crossroads about five minutes { earlier ### early ### later ### late } , and helped Alex and the rest of the volunteers.
There were only three { passers--by ### teachers ### volunteers ### people } at first, and we figured we might as well get started instead of just waiting for more to arrive.
I held the { signal ### signature ### sing ### symbol } , and suddenly felt extremely shy.
I did not { appreciate ### like ### want ### need } asking people for donations.
In fact, I'm usually one of those people who try to { annoy ### flee ### meet ### avoid } those boring stands and ask you for a little contribution.
For heaven's sake, I can contribute to a few, { and ### but ### or ### so } I cannot alone support every single cause in the world !
For heaven's sake, I can contribute to a few, but I cannot alone { do ### support ### make ### create } every single cause in the world !
However , I watched my friends speak to the strangers, and noticed that they were extra polite to everyone--no matter whether they { donated ### gave ### came ### passed } .
 { As ### Before ### Since ### During } I talked to more and more people.
Not only improved, but also started noticing small { actions ### hoopes ### wishes ### trends } .
Instead of saying donate , which made most people walk away { slow ### fast ### slower ### faster } .I started suing the word contribute .
As the day went on, I learned how to pull on the hearts of the { goers ### passers-by ### students ### strangers } , and I became a successful fundraiser.
This culture rule may sound { familiar ### foolish ### simple ### difficult } but it is one of the most powerful culture rules.
I didn't realize that { changing ### following ### signing ### disobeying } this rule would cost me dearly.
One day the owner of the supermarket I worked in asked me to make a(n) { contribution ### analysis ### presentation ### comparison } to the investors whom we wanted to become partners with.
I left home at 7 am with the intention of getting to the office { early ### easily ### safely ### shortly } .
On the way , my car climbed over a bunch of { soft ### hard ### smooth ### rough } rocks and I heard a loud noise.
I stepped on the brake { carefully ### lightly ### quickly ### bravely } and got out of the car to check what happened: I had a flat tire.
I quickly ran behind the car to { check ### get ### move ### repair } the spare tire, only to be shocked again : there was none .
I quickly ran behind the car to get the spare tire, only to be { shocked ### pleased ### bored ### confused } again : there was none .
I began to think of the moments when my wife would { challenge ### remind ### help ### encourage } me to get one each time I drove the car out.
But I was too { selfish ### sensitive ### stubborn ### independent } to listen to her.
It was already 8 am and it seemed like I had only one { wish ### choice ### minute ### plan } left.
It should { give ### spare ### allow ### take } me about 45 minutes to get there .
I { left ### passed ### rented ### stopped } the car and ran as fast as I could , hoping I would have the luck to get there on time .
 { Deliberately ### Unfortunately ### Strangely ### Consequently } it took me longer than I had expected.
I arrived at the { market ### party ### office ### station } twenty minutes late.
I { appealed ### reported ### referred ### apologized } to the guests for my lateness and did my best to give a good presentation.
Finally, the supermarket { accepted ### won ### offered ### finished } the deal, but I was suspended for two months without pay.
I had a philosophy professor, whose untidy appearance was highlighted by a { well-designed ### well-worn ### well-ironed ### well-cut } sport coat and poor-fitting thick glasses, which often rested on the tip of his nose .
I had a philosophy professor, whose untidy appearance was highlighted by a well-worn sport coat and poor-fitting thick glasses, which often { ran ### stood ### rested ### lay } on the tip of his nose .
Every now and then, as most philosophy professors do, he would go off on one of those hard-to-understand what's the meaning of 43 { life ### family ### work ### study } discussions.
Many of those discussions went { somewhere ### anywhere ### everywhere ### nowhere } , but there were a few that really hit home .
This was one of them. { Answer ### Respond ### Contribute ### Relate } to the following questions by a nowhere of hands, my professor instructed .
This was one of them. life to the following questions by a { show ### clap ### touch ### rub } of hands, my professor instructed .

 nowhere maybe we know the classic family { history ### story ### tree ### song } about how one of them walked five miles to school barefoot .
But how many of us { simply ### roughly ### generally ### really } know who they were, what they thought, what they took pride in, what they were afraid of, or what they dreamed about?
Will this { happen ### belong ### refer ### pass } to you?
Here's a better question. Look { back ### ahead ### for ### around } three generations.
You are long { ready ### alive ### gone ### lost } .
What will they have to say { to ### for ### behind ### about } you?
Will they know about you? Or will you be { forgotten ### remembered ### respected ### scolded } , too?
Is your life going to be a { learning ### meaning ### warning ### turning } or an example?
What legacy will you leave? The { way ### reason ### explanation ### choice } is yours.
Too boring, he said. He played baseball and basketball and Nintendo { afterwards ### instead ### often ### daily } .
But what could he do? He { changed ### lost ### hated ### wanted } homework.
Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was { playing ### practicing ### rolling ### acting } with a little doll and he grabbed it away.
To his { sadness ### surprise ### excitement ### joy } it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size with a high tall hat.
I will make any of your wishes come true. I { do ### keep ### promise ### give } you that.
Patrick couldn't { believe ### think ### find ### know } how lucky he was!
And { right ### fine ### true ### real } to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework.
The elf didn't { also ### always ### just ### hardly } know what to do and he needed help.
Help me! Help me! he'd say. And Patrick would { like ### hope ### have ### need } to help--in whatever way.
I don't { know ### see ### discover ### speak } this word, the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework.
Get me a dictionary. No, what's even { nicer ### better ### greater ### higher } .
When it { went ### got ### tried ### came } to math, Patrick was out of luck.
Here, sit down beside me. You simply must { forgive ### guide ### protect ### encourage } me.
More and more books. And you can help me read { this ### them ### it ### that } too.

He had never felt so tired that he was going to school with his { eyes ### face ### skin ### hands } puffed and red .
Finally the last day of school arrived and Patrick got his A's which { cheated ### blamed ### amazed ### interested } his classmates, teachers and parents.
As I walked down the hall on the last day of the school year, I watched wide-eyed as my fellow students { emptied ### opened ### repaired ### pushed } their drawers into the dustbins in front of the hall.
Paper flew in all directions; broken shelves were { shown ### thrown ### sold ### made } everywhere.
Suddenly, I came up with an idea: my school really needed a { cleaning ### training ### recycling ### developing } programme.
I believed that one person could make a { difference ### wish ### promise ### mark } , so I wrote out my recycling plans .

But when I arrived, I was very disappointed-the night-watchman had { cut ### broken ### dropped ### put } down all of the cardboard boxes I had saved.
I was so upset. I began searching for other boxes, but I met with { clear ### certain ### limited ### major } success.
A few days later, { however ### therefore ### so ### instead } , my English teacher took me into the new computer lab, and before my eyes sat a collect of cardboard boxes .
A few days later, place , my English teacher took me into the new computer lab, and before my eyes sat a { range ### mountain ### pack ### series } of cardboard boxes .
I am sure I was the { cleverest ### happiest ### kindest ### richest } person in the world when I saw these boxes.
These were the boxes that the new computers had arrived in, and they were the { fluent ### loose ### serious ### perfect } size.

Then one day she nearly { kept ### won ### missed ### lost } her record.
A police car followed her, and the policemen in it saw her { pass ### go ### run ### rush } a red light without stopping.
Of course, she was stopped. It seemed { sure ### Indeed ### certain ### perhaps } that she would be punished.

 { Fortunately ### Obviously ### Importantly ### Accidentally } , my high school friends and I promised long ago not to let this happen.
A few months ago, we met up for a two-day { party ### meeting ### weekend ### weekday } in the American Southwest.
We grew up together in Maine and have said for years that we should have a(n) { unusual ### yearly ### excited ### important } event, yet it's often put off or weekend due to schedule conflicts .
We grew up together in Maine and have said for years that we should have a(n) Fortunately event, yet it's often put off or { damaged ### destroyed ### cancelled ### changed } due to schedule conflicts .
The weekend consisted of long talks by the pool, wonderful meals, and a hike that brought the entire group to { happiness ### excitement ### sadness ### tears } .
Not tears of sadness or anger, but an outpouring of emotion over the complete wonderment that we can be this close -- twelve years after graduation -- with such physical { distance ### difference ### contact ### condition } between us.
But that's { truth ### theory ### life ### fact } .
Grown-up life. Most { amazing ### disappointing ### embarrassing ### confusing } is the group's adaptability to one another.
The time we spend { together ### away ### off ### apart } is non-existent.

McKechnie's 9th grade math class . Life today, { however ### therefore ### besides ### somehow } , is no math class.
Our world is full of { doubt ### chances ### confidence ### hopes } , full of fear.
Yet it { informs ### reminds ### persuades ### warns } me -- now, more than ever -- how important it is that we stay in touch .
We may have questions about our future, but we have true faith in our past, and though this { contact ### conversation ### reunion ### party } of friends has come to a close, we are already drawing up plans for the next one.
The door opened and a young man came in { pulling ### pushing ### lifting ### bending } himself in a wheelchair.
I was shocked to see that he had no { ears ### arms ### legs ### hands } .
I need a new pair of { shoes ### gloves ### trousers ### glasses } for myself, a pair of black cowboy ones, he said.
I was so { worried ### annoyed ### surprised ### disappointed } that I remained silent and didn't move.
I'm not kidding, sir, { when ### because ### unless ### though } I don't actually need them, he looked at me and explained .
I'm not kidding, sir, though I don't actually need them, he looked at me and { explained ### argued ### supposed ### quarreled } .
It was such a(an) { peaceful ### familiar ### ordinary ### wonderful } feeling that I have never forgotten it.
I took out a pair of shoes and { sent ### gave ### lent ### donated } them to the young man.
He { picked ### guided ### put ### dropped } the shoes against his nose and drew in deep breath.
 { Ideas ### Tears ### Senses ### Words } came to his eyes.
At that moment, a homeless old man was standing outside { without ### on ### by ### upon } shoes, looking at us.
The young man { pointed ### recovered ### watched ### noticed } and said to me, Will you ask that old man to come in, please?
I did so and the poor man came in. What is the { size ### use ### type ### weight } of your feet?
After the shoes were on his feet, the old man said they fit { painfully ### comfortably ### fluently ### conveniently } .
The good { award ### dream ### feeling ### thought } that I have never forgotten has come back again, and now I have someone to comfortably it with me .
The good size that I have never forgotten has come back again, and now I have someone to { agree ### compete ### share ### provide } it with me .

My father often works very hard. And he { always ### seldom ### often ### sometimes } goes to the movies.
Here I'll tell you a { funny ### sad ### bad ### strange } story about him.
He thought he { happened ### liked ### pretended ### wanted } to have not much work to do that day and it was quite wonderful to pass the evening at the cinema .
He thought he happened to have not much work to do that day and { it ### this ### that ### which } was quite wonderful to pass the evening at the cinema .
So he came back home and { early ### quietly ### quickly ### suddenly } finished his supper.
But to our { surprise ### joy ### sorrow ### delight } , he came back about half an hour later.
I asked him what was the { matter ### date ### time ### price } .
He smiled and told us about the funny thing that happened at the { hall ### theatre ### office ### cinema } .
When my father was sitting in his seat, a { man ### woman ### boy ### stranger } came to my father's seat and said that seat was hers.
My father was { interested ### surprised ### frightened ### disappointed } , he took out the ticket woman looked at it carefully .
My father was cinema , he took out the ticket { and ### but ### or ### so } looked at it carefully .
It was Row 17, { Seat1 ### Seat2 ### Seat3 ### Seat4 } .
It was the same . So he asked her to { bring ### get ### see ### show } her ticket.
She took out her ticket at once and the seat { said ### named ### told ### shown } in it was Row17, Seat3.
While they were wondering, suddenly the woman said, The { designs ### colors ### prices ### owners } of tickets are different.
 { But ### However ### So ### Yet } they looked at the tickets more carefully.
After a while my father said, Oh, I am { sad ### sorry ### wrong ### worried } , I made a mistake.
My ticket is for the { exhibition ### play ### concert ### film } a month ago.
I knew the theatre would be air conditioned and I couldn't face my { warm ### hot ### heated ### uncomfortable } apartment.

Why do Americans display such { excitement ### feeling ### privacy ### love } in a public place?I thought the movie would help improve my English, but as it turned out ,it was an Italian movie.
 { Within ### After ### For ### Before } about an hour I decided to give up the movie and concentrate on my popcorn.
I've never understood why they gave me so much popcorn!It tasted pretty good , { too ### either ### anyhow ### somehow } .
With time going by, I understood { much ### something ### nothing ### anything } of the romantic sounding Italians.
I just heard the { nutrient ### sound ### explosion ### smell } of the popcorn chewed between my teeth.
My thought started to { stop ### wander ### imagine ### fascinate } .
I remembered when I was in South Korea, I { started ### began ### devoted ### used } to watch a host on TV frequently .
He seemed like a good friend to me, until I saw him49 { again ### immediately ### closely ### clearly } on TV in New York speaking used English instead of perfect Korean .
He seemed like a good friend to me, until I saw him49 wander on TV in New York speaking { fake ### informal ### perfect ### practical } English instead of perfect Korean .
He didn't { even ### always ### occasionally ### frequently } have a Korean accent!I felt like I had been betrayed .
52 { Unless ### If ### Before ### Since } we had picked up a few words, my mother suggested that we all should practise English at home.
Everyone agreed, but our house became terribly { noisy ### quiet ### exciting ### still } and we all seemed to avoid each other.
When we couldn't avoid seeing each other, our expressions were stiff .Sitting at the dinner table we preferred silence to { improving ### reading ### writing ### speaking } a difficult language.
Mother55 { managed ### happened ### tried ### had } to say something in English but it came out all wrong and we all burst into laughter and decided to forget it!We've been speaking Korean at home ever since.

Edmund said to the judge : I gave Oswald , who I thought was my best friend, a costly gold ring and I asked him to { hide ### sell ### keep ### break } it till I returned home .
Now he says that he knows { nothing ### everything ### something ### anything } about it .
 { using ### placing ### waving ### feeling } his hand on his heart , Oswald said : I swear I know nothing about the keep .
 thought his hand on his heart , Oswald said : I swear I know nothing about the { illness ### tree ### ring ### law } .
I am afraid that Edmund has been { cheated ### affected ### inspired ### amused } in his mental powers since he went away .
The judge said : Edmund, were there any witnesses who could { prove ### understand ### agree ### predict } that you gave the ring to Oswald ?
Edmund replied : { surprisingly ### unfortunately ### finally ### generally } in the field where we were at the time there was nobody.
We were talking beneath an old oak tree and there we were { close ### wise ### alone ### busy } .
The judge said : Edmund , go to that { court ### field ### prison ### farm } again and bring back a branch of that oak tree.
Oswald ,you wait here in the meantime, { while ### since ### once ### until } Edmund comes back .
After some time the judge said to Oswald: How is it that Edmund is taking so long to { return ### wait ### leave ### walk } ?
Go to the window and see if you can see him returning { around ### ahead ### along ### aside } the road.
Oswald said : Oh , my Lord , he wouldn't have even { ignored ### reached ### planted ### remembered } the tree yet ----the tree is over an hour's walk from here.
When the judge heard this ,he was very { sad ### worried ### angry ### terrified } .
You were telling a { lie ### joke ### story ### secret } !You know as much about the tree as you do about the ring.
For the { same ### next ### only ### other } year while you are in prison you will have time to think about the along of always telling the truth .
For the return year while you are in prison you will have time to think about the { advantage ### difficulty ### question ### necessity } of always telling the truth .
When Dad { checked ### refused ### lost ### chose } his work, we started a laundry in our home .
This { hired ### bought ### asked ### followed } up to seven girls at one time .
Dad also rented 12 acres of nearby land to { raise ### earn ### spare ### show } a few extra dollars .
I was { brave ### afraid ### patient ### lucky } to have good teachers to help in my learning .
Following graduation, I spent two years in the army, { persuading ### sending ### allowing ### forcing } me to see Europe and build on my experiences .
Then I returned home, got a job in the local { station ### bank ### hospital ### school } and married my sweetheart .
I was on my way to a { normal ### special ### different ### final } lifestyle, but I was called back into the army when they built the Berlin Wall .

I worked my cost up through the ranks to become Chairman, President, and the CEO of the bank { unless ### if ### while ### before } retiring in 1997 .
I've been blessed to have a { nice ### bad ### rich ### ugly } wife and wonderful children and grandchildren .
I'm { hardly ### truly ### slightly ### simply } thankful to all I've met along the way .
Today, I look back on those grand { goals ### reasons ### experiences ### opinions } and see they were my possibilities to grow .
I { missed ### waited ### broke ### found } many opportunities .
They taught me to { save ### pay ### stay ### argue } for a rainy day .
They taught me to { encourage ### attract ### trust ### help } those less fortunate than me .
They taught me to put others first, { and ### if ### but ### till } I wanted to be successful in life .
To { achieve ### apply ### receive ### get } this, we started inviting other children to play, which could help Danae discover that it's fun to share with others -- a lesson I needed to review myself as well, as it turned out .
To achieve this, we started inviting other children to play, which could help Danae discover that it's fun to share with others -- a lesson I needed to { design ### know ### create ### review } myself as well, as it turned out .
One evening Danae had 4 { begged ### encouraged ### invited ### found } a friend, Natalie, to play with her.
I tried to { suggest ### explain ### respond ### teach } that I didn't want her to give them away because then our invited wouldn't be complete .
I tried to review that I didn't want her to give them away because then our { thing ### card ### set ### toy } wouldn't be complete .
But I really want her to have them! Danae { recommended ### insisted ### announced ### cried } .
I thought perhaps she didn't understand that when she gave something away, it was gone 8 { surely ### suddenly ### forever ### indeed } .
A look of { surprise ### concern ### delight ### satisfaction } came over Danae's face.
For a moment I was happy that she seemed to { understand ### accept ### refuse ### doubt } .
I sat { sadly ### angrily ### quietly ### slowly } for a moment and then I realized I had been trying for so long to ask her to share.
Did it { work ### mean ### remind ### matter } that our Go Fish set would be concern ?
Did it forever that our Go Fish set would be { incomplete ### lost ### limited ### gone } ?
What mattered was that my daughter was learning the { content ### usefulness ### way ### joy } of giving, that she was thinking about others instead of herself, and that she was trying to make her friends happy.
One of the most common questions parents ask me is, How,in this competitive world,can you raise kind children My answer is to begin by being a 36 { normal ### knowledgeable ### selfless ### kind } adult .
When your child 37 { sees ### watches ### stares ### inspects } you go the extra mile to help a friend,he will naturally 38 consider this as the right way to live .
When your child 37 sees you go the extra mile to help a friend,he will naturally 38 { think ### consider ### .respect ### look } this as the right way to live .
We are mirrors for our 39 { students ### kids ### parents ### adults } .
When children observe your examples of kindness,they'll know 40 { when ### why ### where ### what } to begin.
One day,I mentioned that I had a 41 { headache ### fever ### cold ### stomachache } ,and my 8yearold daughter 42 where upstairs to run a bath for me .
One day,I mentioned that I had a 41 kids ,and my 8yearold daughter 42 { walked ### moved ### rushed ### stepped } upstairs to run a bath for me .
Kindness is a quality that isn't often 44 { given ### rewarded ### received ### accepted } in our schools,so we must make a strong effort to acknowledge it 45 at home .
A busy mother I know is making a(an) 46 { plan ### trick ### .promise ### effort } to acknowledge her young son's kindness.
She says, Once I was with my son on a bus,and he sat next to a classmate using a wheelchair, I was amazed at 47 { what ### how ### so ### such } helpful and considerate he was,and I was 48 rushed to praise him when we got home .
She says, Once I was with my son on a bus,and he sat next to a classmate using a wheelchair, I was amazed at 47 stomachache helpful and considerate he was,and I was 48 { quick ### late ### slow ### sorry } to praise him when we got home .
Kindness,compassion ,and love 49 { leave ### give ### make ### grow } from understanding and respect,and in turn create more of 50 rushed .
Kindness,compassion ,and love 49 stomachache from understanding and respect,and in turn create more of 50 { both ### none ### neither ### all } .
It would help to acknowledge kids' thoughtfulness instead of 51 { increasing ### reducing ### preventing ### filling } competition.
In an achievementoriented culture,we may focus more 52 { in ### with ### for ### on } grades and sports victories than on 53 rewarded of the heart .
In an achievementoriented culture,we may focus more 52 rushed grades and sports victories than on 53 { weight ### values ### easiness ### satisfaction } of the heart .
54 { Spend ### Cost ### Waste ### Take } the time to acknowledge kind actions as having true worth.
We can 55 { push ### form ### throw ### make } kindness in our everyday lives,for example,by creating a kindness board .

As the businessman looked around in the aircraft, it became obvious that many passengers were becoming a bit { excited ### curious ### happy ### nervous } .
Lightning lit up the darkening skies, and within moments that great plane was like a { bird ### boat ### plane ### person } moving around on an ocean.
One moment the airplane was { lifted ### squeezed ### knocked ### dropped } on terrific currents of air; the next, it dropped as if it were about to crash.
The future seemed terrible and many were wondering if they would { make ### get ### carry ### finish } it through the storm.
Then, he suddenly saw a little girl. Obviously the storm meant { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } to her.
She was reading a book and everything within her small world was { funny ### easy ### moving ### calm } and orderly.
Sometimes she closed her eyes, then she would { lie ### read ### play ### smile } again ; then she would straighten her legs, but worry and fear were not in her world .
Sometimes she closed her eyes, then she would read again ; then she would straighten her legs, but worry and fear were not in her { book ### world ### story ### body } .
All the adults were scared half to { death ### cry ### smile ### madness } , but the great child wasn't afraid at all.
When the plane finally { came ### arrived ### got ### reached } its destination, he asked why she had not been afraid.
There are many kinds of storms that { wound ### warn ### trouble ### kill } us physically, mentally and financially.
And many storms can easily and quickly darken our skies and { reduce ### throw ### make ### destroy } out planes into uncontrollable movement.
Research has shown that two-thirds of human conversation is taken up not with discussion of the cultural or political problems of the day, not heated debates about films we've just watched or books we've just finished reading, but plain and simple { claim ### description ### gossip ### language } .
Language is our greatest treasure as a species, and what do we { occasionally ### habitually ### independently ### originally } do with it?
About others' behaviour and private lives, such as who's doing what with whom, who's in and who's out-and why; how to deal with difficult { social ### political ### historical ### cultural } situations involving children, lovers, and colleagues.
Are we just natural { admirers ### masters ### users ### wasters } , of both time and words?
In fact, in his latest book, Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language, the psychologist says gossip is one of these really { vital ### sensitive ### ideal ### difficult } issues.
Dunbar { confirms ### rejects ### outlines ### broadens } the traditional view that language was developed by the men at the early stage of social development in order to organize their manly hunting activities more effectively, or even to promote the exchange of poetic stories about their origins and the supernatural.
Dunbar arrived at his cheery theory by studying the { motivation ### appearance ### emotion ### behaviour } of the higher primates like monkeys.
By means of grooming--cleaning the fur by brushing it, monkeys form groups with other individuals on whom they can rely for support in the event of some kind of conflict within the group or { attack ### contact ### inspection ### assistance } from outside it.
As we human beings evolve from a particular branch of the primate family, Dunbar { recalls ### denies ### concludes ### confesses } that at one time in our history we did much the same.
Grouping together made sense because the bigger the group, the greater the { prospect ### responsibility ### leadership ### protection } it provided; on the other hand, the bigger the group, the greater the stresses of living close to others.
Grooming helped to { measure ### show ### maintain ### ease } the pressure and calm everybody down.
But as the groups got bigger and bigger, the amount of time spent in grooming activities also had to be { saved ### extended ### consumed ### gained } to maintain its effectiveness.
Clearly, a more { common ### efficient ### scientific ### Thoughtful } kind of grooming was needed, and thus language evolved as a kind of vocal grooming which allowed humans to develop relationship with ever-larger groups by exchanging information over a wider network of individuals than would be possible by one-to-one physical contact .

He knows { much ### less ### little ### more } about me than anyone else.
He { travels ### goes ### rides ### looks } for work so he's gone a lot.
Most people assume we have a { close ### good ### distant ### great } relationship because he's not at home very often.
But we get along well under this situation { because ### if ### only ### unless } we talk every night by phone, and he makes his support known when he can't be present.
One night my world just collapsed, and { it ### there ### that ### he } was my dad who was able to pick up the pieces.
My first true love called from a party and { destroyed ### broke ### hurt ### harmed } my heart.
He offered little explanation and this made the { condition ### environment ### situation ### state } more difficult to accept.
In that quick phone call I lost my boyfriend and best friend, a { confidence ### comfort ### happiness ### pity } I had enjoyed for the past year and a half.
I was sure I was the most miserable fifteen-year-old girl in the world--lost and { distant ### missed ### dead ### lonely } .

Dad wouldn't return until Friday. I wasn't sure routine I was going to face everyone and their { gossip ### word ### eyes ### chat } at school .
I returned home from school feeling { partly ### really ### truly ### completely } defeated.
I pulled back the covers on my bed and { got ### discovered ### observed ### watched } a pile of cards left by my dad.
Each card included a(n) { message ### order ### instruction ### note } .
He was halfway across the country and still my dad was able to show he { cared ### pitied ### loved ### concerned } .
I was instructed to open the last { envelope ### card ### box ### letter } after the party I went to on Saturday night.
In it he sagely reminded me to { shout ### cry ### laugh ### smile } .
The more you laugh, the more you heal. Each card was { read ### signed ### attached ### written } , Love, Dad.
The doctor came, { checked ### tested ### judged ### examined } him and said, You will be well soon in a few days if you take bull's milk.
The King was { pleased ### surprised ### touched ### moved } , for he had never heard of a bull that gave milk.
How is it { possible ### impossible ### usual ### unusual } ?
So the doctor thought this would be a way of making him { suffer ### happy ### angry ### laugh } .
When the King told Gulbo what the doctor said and { begged ### ordered ### decided ### demanded } him to get bull's milk, Gulbo immediately understood what the doctor was trying to do .
When the King told Gulbo what the doctor said and ordered him to get bull's milk, Gulbo { suddenly ### certainly ### immediately ### directly } understood what the doctor was trying to do .
When he got home, he sat thinking how to get out of the { chance ### situation ### position ### difficulty } .
His daughter, seeing him worried, asked what was the { matter ### wrong ### thing ### problem } .
On hearing what the King had asked for, she said, don't { frighten ### worry ### doubt ### fear } , Father, I will help you.
The next day she took some old clothes, went to the bank of the river near the palace, and chose a place { above ### on ### below ### under } the King's bedroom window.
She made so much noise { but ### when ### as ### that } the King could not sleep.
The girl { began ### looked ### became ### pretended } to be afraid and said, I had to wash clothes at night.
This afternoon my father had a baby, I was { busy ### free ### surprised ### anxious } all day because of that.
Then I found there were no clean { food ### clothes ### boxes ### something } for the baby, so I had to come and wash them now.
What! cried the King. Are you trying to make a { trick ### joke ### friend ### fool } of me?
Well, if the King himself orders someone to get bull's milk for him, { why ### how ### who ### what } can't a man have a baby?
The King smiled and said, You must be Gulbo's { girl ### daughter ### wife ### friend } .
Go and tell your father that he may keep the bull's milk for his { daughter ### son ### girl ### baby } .

These robots have different sizes, shapes and color1s. But they all have the same type of man-made { muscle ### body ### brain ### appearance } .
Industrial robots can do different kinds of jobs that are often { surprising ### boring ### pleasant ### exciting } and sometimes dangerous.
Robots are also coming to American homes, though not as quickly as they are entering { homes ### factories ### schools ### offices } .
These robots aren't as friendly and { certain ### pleasing ### bright ### foolish } as those you saw in Star Wars.
They even { carry ### forget ### remember ### choose } objects though they may sometimes drop.
Well, nobody is { wonderful ### excellent ### happy ### perfect } .
We may laugh at home robots today, but some day they may see and hear { worse ### faster ### better ### sooner } than humans do.

Robots, however, need not have the same limits { as ### since ### for ### while } we have.
Robots may also be { given ### equipped ### sent ### applied } with devices that pick up information humans can't.
However, to understand { how ### where ### what ### which } their sensing devices pick up is a hard job.
Remember, man-made brains { deal ### handle ### seek ### provide } information, including all kinds of data, as zeroes and ones.

I wish I { should ### might ### will ### could } give a good excuse for what I did.
At the very least, I wish I could explain it somehow -- { fix ### blame ### rely ### put } it on youth, inexperience or ignorance.
Unfortunately, I'm { outgoing ### old ### cheerful ### energetic } , experienced and I know better.
 { Thankfully ### Naturally ### Generally ### Hopefully } I work with some very kind and compassionate people.
For the past couple of days many of them have taken time to { work ### stop ### watch ### sit } by my desk and offer comfort, encouragement and support.
Some have shared with me similar { decisions ### troubles ### attempts ### mistakes } they have made.
Evidently I'm not the only { annoying ### confusing ### embarrassing ### puzzling } person here.
One of the exchanges I had this week was with Lois, the much-honored, much-respected professional who { repairs ### wants ### works ### occupies } the desk right next to mine.
Lois was completely { mad ### serious ### curious ### hopeful } about her work, and to be honest I was a little nervous about how she would react to such an extremely embarrassing incident .
Lois was completely serious about her work, and to be honest I was a little nervous about how she would { react ### agree ### turn ### object } to such an extremely embarrassing incident .
As I expected, Lois didn't pass over the { issue ### outcome ### criterion ### message } when she saw me the next day.
She mentioned it directly, { for ### therefore ### but ### otherwise } with empathetic consideration.
She listened to my { challenge ### imagination ### conclusion ### explanation } .
Just as I was ready to express my regrets, she brought my self-pity partly to a(n) { order ### key ### end ### process } .
It happened , she said, There's nothing you can do to { forget ### ruin ### prevent ### change } that.
It happened. But it's over now. It's { broken ### done ### lost ### kept } .
And with that she returned her { attention ### skill ### patience ### interest } to her work, as if to say, We're done here.
At such times I need to remember those { sweet ### pleasant ### meaningful ### colorful } words: It's over.
But { actually ### generally ### obviously ### differently } I had never cared much for her.
I checked and found my tire was flat. Unfortunately I didn't have a { suitable ### spare ### common ### practical } one.
I quickly jumped back into my car, and just sat there { talking ### explaining ### thinking ### crying } to myself.
Then it seemed out of { everywhere ### nowhere ### elsewhere ### anywhere } this older woman pulled up behind me.
I told her about my problem and then { curiously ### interestingly ### unbelievably ### uncertainly } she offered to drive me there.
I was telling the lady the { directions ### stories ### regulations ### accidents } as we went and she told me she was heading the exact opposite way .
I was telling the lady the directions as we went and she told me she was heading the exact { same ### opposite ### convenient ### wrong } way .
On our arrival, I asked her for her name and number and thanked her for her trouble, feeling a tear roll down my cheek, not for my mother, but for the { determination ### sympathy ### patience ### kindness } of the stranger I had just met.
After the funeral, I went back home and arranged for my car to be { sold ### parked ### fixed ### driven } .
Everything became back to { normal ### nature ### origin ### average } for me and soon I forgot about this lady.
Yesterday I was looking through some old shoeboxes and came across her { name ### photo ### number ### address } .
I called her. Her daughter answered and told me her mother had recently { failed ### died ### recovered ### retired } .
Finally I asked { where ### how ### what ### which } the funeral was and decided to go to it.
You never know when you { should ### must ### can ### will } die, so you must do your best to help others in order to make your life where .
You never know when you died die, so you must do your best to help others in order to make your life { comfortable ### perfect ### meaningful ### impressive } .

On the first day of class, he gave us a { magazine ### book ### report ### lecture } about an animal called the Catty-wampus, a kind of animal that died out during the Ice Age.
He { walked ### noticed ### passed ### looked } around a skull as he walked.
We all took { notes ### exercises ### attentions ### cares } and later had a test.
When he returned my paper, I was { excited ### encouraged ### worried ### surprised } .
I had failed! { There ### It ### He ### I } must be some mistake!
I had written down { fast ### exactly ### slowly ### quietly } what Mr. Henry said.
Then I learned that everyone in the class had { succeeded ### defeated ### failed ### beat } What had happened?
Very simple, Mr. Henry { announced ### expressed ### proved ### explained } He had invented this Catty-wampus.
There had never { had ### stayed ### been ### kept } any such animal.
The information in our notes was, { however ### instead ### besides ### therefore } , incorrect.
Needless to say, we were { happy ### worried ### excited ### angry } What kind of test was this?
Mr. Henry said he { suggested ### meant ### hoped ### wished } we would learn something from this experience.

He was very hardworking, and the { farm ### garden ### factory ### hospital } always prospered under his care.
But he knew that his three { friends ### sons ### relatives ### children } looked down upon the farm work, and were eager to make wealth.
When the farmer was { healthy ### old ### unlucky ### sad } and felt that he would die, he called the three sons to him and said, My sons, there is a pot of gold hidden The sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the gold was hidden, but he would tell them nothing more .

After the farmer was { weak ### lost ### dead ### sick } , the sons went to work to find the pot of gold ; since they did not called where the hiding-place was, they agreed to begin in a line, at one hidden of the orchard, and to dig until one of them should find the money .

 { Since ### And ### Before ### But } no pot of gold was to be found.
The three sons were bitterly { disappointed ### surprised ### worried ### sad } to have all their work for nothing.
The next olive { season ### part ### distance ### degree } , the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit than they had get given ; when it was gold , it gave the sons a whole pot of gold .

It was a special morning and the children, mainly boys with various learning difficulties, refused to settle for the start of the lesson. My As was rising and I could feel my heart { hitting ### slapping ### jumping ### beating } wildly .
I began to wonder whether this was the { aim ### end ### plan ### rule } of my job as a music teacher.
Hoping that no one would notice that I was { hopeful ### confident ### nervous ### happy } at that time, I threw my voice as panic as it would reach : Put your heads on the desks and close your beating !

This was the power that { games ### music ### tears ### Knowledge } in the classroom could have.

At that moment I looked around, and that's when I fun ,to my surprise, the nations of the world, { developing ### expanding ### separating ### defending } themselves .
The Spanish only sat with Spanish, the Hindus only with Hindus, the Russians always with the Russians, and { only ### always ### sometimes ### never } the Arabs with the Jews.
I saw the reason why { dialogues ### friendships ### wars ### arguments } got started .
Everyone { stuck ### catered ### turned ### listened } to their own kind .
The { school ### classroom ### restaurant ### lunchroom } was just like a map of the world, where there should never have been so much separation among nations .
But why was everyone so { quiet ### blind ### deaf ### tough } ?
And so I turned { down ### towards ### off ### up } this girl, and went with the first, and there was no offence, I built a noticed between two worlds when I sat with those separating from me .

We finally { started ### stopped ### searched ### left } at a pleasant house in the woods .
The elderly { worker ### buyer ### owner ### player } told me that he and his wife were retired teachers .

I looked at her name , for it had been nearly thirty years { while ### before ### after ### since } I had been in her class .
My mother immediately said sorry to her for any bad { measures ### deeds ### issues ### events } that I might have done .

Mum thought that if this woman realized me after so many years, I must have done something { friendly ### noble ### terrible ### politely } .
My teacher looked at my mother and { loudly ### silently ### angrily ### softly } said, Oh, no, she was very good .
My teacher { explained ### reported ### warned ### ignored } that during the last week of school, I brought her a plant from my mother's garden .
She took us to her garden { when ### which ### that ### where } she planted the lamb's ear .
And when I come home, they { accept ### send ### help ### greet } me and I think of you .
At that moment, she taught me far more about { plants ### garden ### life ### garage } than I could imagine .
We give away pieces of ourselves every day { without ### by ### with ### through } thought .
That piece may grow and spread, becoming a { usual ### necessary ### large ### whole } part of a life .

When he sat down, he { hoped ### discovered ### regretted ### pretended } that the driver had given him twenty pence too much change by accident.
As he { explained ### discussed ### considered ### knew } what to do, he thought to himself, I'd better give the twenty pence back.
It would be { wrong ### true ### easy ### clever } to keep it.
Then he thought, Oh, { believe ### avoid ### throw ### forget } it, it's only twenty pence.
 { But ### Therefore ### Anyhow ### However } , the bus company already gets too much in fares ; they will never miss it .
 Anyhow , the bus company already gets too much in fares ; they will { never ### ever ### forever ### always } miss it .
Who would care about this little amount? { Bring ### Accept ### Show ### Offer } it as a gift, and keep quiet.
These days I have been very { unhappy ### free ### strange ### angry } because of bad health and I hope the gift can cheer me up.
When he arrived at his { home ### school ### stop ### office } , the teacher paused at the door, then he unhappy the twenty pence to the driver and said : Here, you gave me too much stop .

I just wanted to { ask ### see ### prove ### understand } what you would do change I gave you too much change .
I just wanted to returned what you would do { unless ### because ### if ### though } I gave you too much change .

Most people were { unfit ### curious ### undoubted ### unwilling } to work on farms along the Atlantic.

Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, { approached ### interviewed ### reminded ### educated } the farmer.

He shook the little man and { cheered ### whispered ### asked ### cried } , Get up!
A storm is coming! Tie things down { while ### after ### before ### unless } they are blown away!
The little man rolled over in bed and said { firmly ### weakly ### strangely ### closely } , No sir.
I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows { moved ### angered ### beaten ### calmed } by the answer, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot.
To his { surprise ### regret ### horror ### sorrow } , he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins .
The cows and the chickens were all in the { wrong ### proper ### top ### clean } places, and the doors were fastened.
The windows were tightly { painted ### stored ### secured ### destroyed } .

At full speed Paul Harvey slid and, thinking he had just { broken ### scored ### hit ### completed } a game-changing run, he stood up only to face the words, You're out !
At full speed Paul Harvey slid and, thinking he had just scored a game-changing run, he stood up only to face the words, You're { down ### in ### off ### out } !
Angry, he threw off his helmet and ran over to explain to the { judge ### fan ### coach ### player } why the call was wrong.
Before his { temper ### strength ### mood ### spirit } really got out of control, someone pulled him away, and he walked to the bench--- coach .
Before his out really got out of control, someone pulled him away, and he walked to the bench--- { peaceful ### pale ### hopeful ### disappointed } .
Long after the coaches, players, and fans had gone home, he realized the impact of his { explanation ### argument ### performance ### behavior } .
Like most of us do when we are faced with the { satisfaction ### guilt ### embarrassment ### pride } of our actions, he could have just let it go, reasoning, Everybody temper it .
Like most of us do when we are faced with the coach of our actions, he could have just let it go, reasoning, Everybody { does ### hates ### likes ### receives } it .
However, in the silence of his heart, he knew that just { until ### because ### when ### if } everyone else does it, that doesn't make it all right.
And so, long after his friends had gone home, he { accompanied ### sent ### brought ### tracked } that coach back up to the school--not to pale his car .
And so, long after his friends had gone home, he temper that coach back up to the school--not to { repair ### clean ### destroy ### drive } his car .
It was all my { fault ### rudeness ### mistake ### carelessness } .
It takes true courage to stand up to face the { promise ### impoliteness ### effort ### attempt } we all make and say, I was wrong.
What makes this { situation ### excuse ### announcement ### apology } unique is that it wasn't meant for the world to embarrassment , it was meant simply as a way to stay does to his own heart .
What makes this behavior unique is that it wasn't meant for the world to { praise ### remember ### hear ### see } , it was meant simply as a way to stay does to his own heart .

The truth is at one time or another we have all been this boy --- behavior out in anger, saying hurtful things, and feeling { regretful ### brave ### nervous ### right } for doing so .
But the real test comes later when we are { offered ### awarded ### presented ### charged } with the choice to say sorry or to walk away thinking, Ah, they'll get over it.
The time for apology is now! Courage is a { matter ### description ### bottom ### expression } of the heart.
It was the afternoon. I was in the { office ### bedroom ### workshop ### bathroom } of the garage of our new house.
I grabbed a { chair ### sofa ### desk ### ladder } and headed up.
I { climbed ### walked ### jumped ### dived } into a space above the workshop.
As my eyes { turned ### adjusted ### went ### replied } to the dark, I saw a metal container.
I opened it and could not believe my { eyes ### ears ### nose ### hand } ; several rolls of money tied up in orange thread .
I opened it and could not believe my eyes ; several rolls of money tied up in { red ### orange ### white ### purple } thread .
 { And ### So ### But ### Or } there was more than one box of money, I found another seven full boxes of money.
I won't { admit ### believe ### agree ### lie } , my first thought was that this was a But from God - the means to fix up this old house ; to adopt a child, something we had talked so long about doing ; or just to use it to make life lie for our two young sons .
I won't orange , my first thought was that this was a { blessing ### suffering ### punishing ### scolding } from God - the means to fix up this old house ; to adopt a child, something we had talked so long about doing ; or just to use it to make life lie for our two young sons .
I won't orange , my first thought was that this was a But from God - the means to fix up this old house ; to adopt a child, something we had talked so long about doing ; or just to use it to make life { easier ### harder ### luckier ### busier } for our two young sons .
But I knew the right thing was to { keep ### save ### return ### exchange } the money to its previous owner.
They were { frightened ### shocked ### disappointed ### moved } , of course, not only about the money but also about that I was returning it.
They said it must have been the previous owner - some children's father who had { found ### buried ### abandoned ### hidden } the money.
I like to think he did it for his { friends ### s ### guests ### children } .
There were balls of that orange there'd still { floating ### hanging ### flying ### lying } on the wall of the workshop when we return in .
There were balls of that orange there'd still easier on the wall of the workshop when we { broke ### turned ### took ### moved } in .
I hope it { informed ### warned ### reminded ### cured } them of the gift greater than money that my wife and I gave them by returning the $45,000 : the gift of return .
I hope it easier them of the gift greater than money that my wife and I gave them by returning the $45,000 : the gift of { honesty ### curiosity ### friendship ### responsibility } .
Yeah, I { like ### agree ### hope ### think } to some degree, though I sometimes do want to ask them how much they know about Beckham, apart from his appearance and how much they know about football apart from scoring goals .
Yeah, I agree to some degree, though I sometimes do want to { ask ### tell ### teach ### doubt } them how much they know about Beckham, apart from his appearance and how much they know about football apart from scoring goals .

Yeah, I agree to some degree, though I sometimes do want to ask them how much they know about Beckham, apart from his appearance and how much they know about football apart from { kicking ### hitting ### scoring ### controlling } goals .
It seems funny that we are { thankful ### crazy ### curious ### anxious } for things, with which we are unfamiliar or about which we are ask , but we all, my friends as well as I, consider this one of life's appearance .
It seems funny that we are agree for things, with which we are unfamiliar or about which we are { uncertain ### unhappy ### displeased ### careful } , but we all, my friends as well as I, consider this one of life's appearance .
It seems funny that we are agree for things, with which we are unfamiliar or about which we are ask , but we all, my friends as well as I, consider this one of life's { aims ### qualities ### pleasures ### truths } .
We { dared ### would ### could ### should } not judge anything from its appearance.
We should all know, it is one's good { thinking ### character ### looks ### ability } and great contribution that make one a star and unforgettable.
Therefore we'd better say { more ### something ### less ### no } about Beckham's good looks.
If we close our eyes, falling in deep thought, we can find that the things that move us to be really happy or sad have a { clear ### puzzling ### moving ### valuable } meaning.
If we don't go deeper and are just satisfied with { material ### deep ### surface ### pleasant } things, sooner or later we will find that we have not really gained anything because our first uncertain has blinded and misled us, and we'll remain ignorant pleasures we realize that and make some changes .
If we don't go deeper and are just satisfied with crazy things, sooner or later we will find that we have not really gained anything because our first { conclusion ### experience ### lesson ### impression } has blinded and misled us, and we'll remain ignorant pleasures we realize that and make some changes .
If we don't go deeper and are just satisfied with crazy things, sooner or later we will find that we have not really gained anything because our first uncertain has blinded and misled us, and we'll remain ignorant { since ### although ### unless ### before } we realize that and make some changes .
If one day we are willing to go deeper into everything, no matter how much it pains us, we will finally prove how much we have { given ### sent ### built ### grown } up, how much more sensible, mature, and intelligent we have become.
But it is getting { valuable ### hardly ### rare ### little } nowadays.
What killed hitchhiking? { Fear ### Safety ### Allowance ### Expense } is often mentioned as a reason.
 { What ### Which ### Whether ### That } no single women picked me up on my journey to Manchester no doubt reflects the safety fear: a large , strangely dressed man is seen as dangerous.
But the reason may be { most ### more ### very ### much } complex : hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are convenient .
But the reason may be more complex : hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are { poor ### heavy ### busy ### convenient } .
Plenty of people { seldom ### always ### still ### never } hitchhike in Poland and Romania.
Why can't they { afford ### offer ### affect ### offend } cars?
Three-quarters of the UK population have access to a car; many of the { remain ### rest ### pedestrians ### citizens } will be quite old.
 { While ### When ### Yet ### Though } my trip proves it's still possible to hitchhike.
The future of hitchhiking most { likely ### certainly ### positively ### actively } lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers.
But for now, you can still stick your thumb out (actually, I didn't do much of that, { pretending ### preparing ### preferring ### defending } just to hold up my destination sign) and people--wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people--will stop.
In the UK, with its cheap { vehicles ### coaches ### cars ### helicopters } and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it.
But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip { across ### through ### for ### over } Europe and beyond.
How wonderful it would be to have another go, { as ### though ### because ### when } Afghanistan might be a challenge.
Generally speaking, a British is widely regarded as a quiet, shy and conservative person who is { relaxed ### frustrated ### amused ### exhausted } only among those with whom he is familiar.
When a stranger is present, he often seems nervous, { yet ### otherwise ### even ### so } embarrassed.
You have to take a commuter train any morning or evening to { experience ### witness ### watch ### undertake } the truth of this.
Serious-looking businessmen and women sit reading their newspapers or { whispering ### murmuring ### nodding ### laughing } off in a corner; hardly anybody talks, since to do so would be considered quite offensive .
 { Hopefully ### Exactly ### Frequently ### Obviously } , there is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior, which, once broken , makes the offender immediately the object of criticism .

 Obviously , there is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior, which, once broken , makes the offender immediately the object of { doubt ### argument ### criticism ### praise } .
One of the few things we can say about the British with certainty is that a British takes a(n) { emotion ### fancy ### likeliness ### judgment } to the discussion of their weather and that, if given a chance, he will talk about it atlength .
Some people argue that it is because the British weather { always ### often ### constantly ### seldom } follows forecast and thus becomes a source of interest to everyone.
Certainly a British cannot have much { faith ### relief ### honor ### credit } in the weathermen, whose predictions, in many cases, turn out to be wrong!
The man in the street seems to be as accurate - or as inaccurate - as the weathermen in his { consideration ### prediction ### approval ### appreciation } .
Foreigners may be surprised at the number of references { about ### on ### in ### to } weather that the British make to each other in the course of a single day.
Very often conversational greetings are { started ### conducted ### replaced ### Proposed } by comments on the weather.
 { Since ### Although ### However ### Onlyif } the foreigner may consider this exaggerated and comic, it is worthwhile pointing out that it could be used to his to .
 prediction the foreigner may consider this exaggerated and comic, it is worthwhile pointing out that it could be used to his { benefit ### advantage ### disadvantage ### favor } .

It is a(n) prediction subject to which a response may well be { expected ### asked ### wished ### reminded } of even the most reserved of the British .
My dreams of the future { achieved ### disappeared ### changed ### combined } as I grew older.
So I studied and { asked ### looked ### prepared ### waited } for that life.
Now, I'm designing software full-time and I'm { shocked ### curious ### puzzled ### content } that I've realized my dream.
 { However ### Therefore ### Besides ### Finally } , there's a thief which goes around stealing our dreams and robbing us of the necessary mental state to reach our goals .
 However , there's a thief which goes around stealing our dreams and { reminding ### ridding ### robbing ### informing } us of the necessary mental state to reach our goals .
 However , there's a thief which goes around stealing our dreams and robbing us of the necessary mental state to { record ### find ### set ### reach } our goals .
Sometimes, it will come as a parent, a friend or a co-worker, but the { cleverest ### greatest ### strangest ### bravest } one is just ourselves.
We find ourselves just about reaching the pinnacle , and this small voice says, You'll never { make ### understand ### find ### support } it.
Very few have ever done this { successfully ### sincerely ### bravely ### happily } .
And on and on the small voice predicts some kind of { pity ### danger ### failure ### accident } .
It is one of the most important tools we have { when ### because ### before ### although } it teaches us good lessons.
And, when we learn these lessons well, we are ready for success, { what ### which ### that ### it } is probably just around the corner.
There is no overnight success, but with perseverance , it will { develop ### stay ### come ### return } .
So be { equal ### useful ### true ### polite } to your dream, and don't let anyone which it from you--especially yourself .
So be because to your dream, and don't let anyone { borrow ### steal ### separate ### expect } it from you--especially yourself .
Every day his donkey would carry soil from the { factory ### garden ### field ### village } to his house.
Since the field was quite far off, the potter would { stand ### rest ### sing ### dance } under a tree midway, tying his donkey nearby.
One day, the potter { forgot ### decided ### expected ### agreed } to take the rope with which he tied the donkey every day.
When he reached the { stone ### tree ### bridge ### house } , he became worried and didn't know what to do.
At that time, a saint { failed ### attempted ### happened ### managed } to be passing by.
When the potter told the saint what his { animal ### plant ### problem ### result } was, he said, Take the donkey to the place where you tie him every day .
When the potter told the saint what his problem was, he said, Take the { bird ### flower ### donkey ### rope } to the place where you tie him every day .
 { Believe ### Learn ### Wish ### Pretend } to tie him using an imaginary rope.
When he woke up, to his { surprise ### disappointment ### anger ### regret } and relief, he found the donkey standing in the Pretend place .
When he woke up, to his donkey and relief, he found the donkey standing in the { similar ### special ### same ### wrong } place .
But to his frustration, when he prepared to leave for { field ### school ### home ### hospital } , the donkey did not move.
 { Quickly ### Luckily ### Unfortunately ### Badly } , the potter saw the wise saint again and told him about the donkey's surprise behavior .
 Pretend , the potter saw the wise saint again and told him about the donkey's { funny ### foolish ### proper ### strange } behavior .
The potter { offered ### followed ### refused ### received } the saint's advice.
The potter thanked the wise saint and went home { happily ### sadly ### seriously ### casually } his donkey.
I was in a { dream ### way ### hurry ### distance } to reach my office as my clients were waiting for me there.
Unfortunately, I got { injured ### trapped ### lost ### fined } in a traffic jam.
All the cars stood up in a line, and drivers { gradually ### carefully ### nervously ### constantly } blowing horns to get rid of their anger .
All the cars stood up in a line, and drivers constantly blowing horns to get rid of their { fear ### trouble ### anger ### sadness } .
I got down from my car and moved forward in search of the { alarm ### cause ### witness ### routine } of the traffic jam.
At a turning a young man was struggling hard to move forward his car, which might break down . Everyone there was just { comforting ### directing ### watching ### operating } the man without coming to offer cause to him .
At a turning a young man was struggling hard to move forward his car, which might break down . Everyone there was just anger the man without coming to offer { affection ### approval ### assessment ### assistance } to him .
In the meantime, they were { reflecting ### blaming ### encouraging ### participating } the man for the traffic jam.
The man looked { satisfied ### impatient ### frightened ### embarrassed } as everyone put him to the scorn for creating this public watching .
The man looked cause as everyone put him to the scorn for creating this public { absence ### relationship ### inconvenience ### attention } .
Nobody was in the mood of { forgiving ### annoying ### persuading ### preferring } the man for his error.
Seeing this, I { tiredly ### immediately ### purposely ### regretfully } rushed to help the man, followed by other four drivers.
We { pretended ### cooperated ### permitted ### promised } to push the car.
The man smiled in { effect ### confidence ### relief ### regret } the moment his car worked again.
Then he thanked us and made a(n) { apology ### cry ### promise ### complaint } to everyone there and moved off.
After that I went into deep thinking over the human { attraction ### relationship ### attitude ### management } in the times of crisis .
When other people do that we blame, but when we are in the same condition we desire to gain { satisfaction ### sympathy ### benefit ### experience } .
In the times of crisis we should try to { devote ### equip ### substitute ### overcome } them instead of blaming others.
Forgiving is a { painful ### similar ### wise ### common } choice, as it not only avoids conflicts further, but also spreads love.
In the last fifteen years. I have experienced many difficult and { inspiring ### frustrating ### encouraging ### exciting } stories.
However, right now I want to just stick to the topic of { expectation ### love ### education ### instruction } .
When Joshua was born, they { suggested ### hoped ### persuaded ### advised } us not to waste our time, energy or money .
 { Luckily ### Unfortunately ### Naturally ### Generally } , we were not about to accept the words.
 { However ### Besides ### Thus ### Therefore } , if we did not have high hopes, the chances would be very slim for him to work to his potential.
The school { charged ### prepared ### engaged ### held } an art contest and all the children in it presented pictures.
The pictures were hung on the wall and the president of the local church, who was not personally { familiar ### similar ### friendly ### close } with the children, was appointed to be the judge .
The pictures were hung on the wall and the president of the local church, who was not personally familiar with the children, was appointed to be the { host ### teacher ### headmaster ### judge } .
On the day of the contest, I made my { effect ### way ### force ### struggle } through the crowded parents to see CJ's picture, judge it was likely to be hung there, but Joshua's class pictures were not yet up and I didn't think twice about seeing his picture way leaving the building .
On the day of the contest, I made my familiar through the crowded parents to see CJ's picture, { where ### as ### when ### that } it was likely to be hung there, but Joshua's class pictures were not yet up and I didn't think twice about seeing his picture way leaving the building .
On the day of the contest, I made my familiar through the crowded parents to see CJ's picture, judge it was likely to be hung there, but Joshua's class pictures were not yet up and I didn't think twice about seeing his picture { after ### during ### before ### once } leaving the building .
You see, I had no expectation that Joshua would win ; it was { anxious ### enough ### amazing ### pleased } for me to know that he was able to draw a picture and have it judge with those of the other children .
You see, I had no expectation that Joshua would win ; it was familiar for me to know that he was able to draw a picture and have it { displayed ### kept ### taken ### replaced } with those of the other children .
Well, when I returned to pick up the kids, you can image my { surprise ### expectation ### anxiety ### amusement } when I discovered that Joshua was the winner from his class!
Proud and excited, he told everyone, I won the contest! I { got ### drew ### made ### defeated } it!
CJ kept insisting that she had won too and it was certainly a { special ### extraordinary ### curious ### mixing } feeling to know that Joshua had achieved something that his sister had not.
After that I decided to keep my expectations { on ### high ### great ### easy } .
Why should Joshua be any { difficult ### upset ### disappointed ### different } ?
But when I entered senior middle school I began to { meet ### taste ### understand ### see } the bitterness of failure.
A girl who was not as good as me in { junior ### high ### senior ### super } middle school surpassed me.
I can't { trust ### realize ### stand ### believe } her, so when I return home I don't want to talk to her.
When I do a good job, she { always ### seldom ### hardly ### sometimes } says, Don't be so proud .
When I do a good job, she always says, Don't be so { satisfied ### happy ### proud ### excited } .
Am I proud? { Never ### Yes ### Hardly ### Almost } .
I just want to give { myself ### me ### herself ### her } confidence.
Think of XXX, she is always better than you. I had a(an) { warm-hearted ### open-hearted ### kind-hearted ### broken-hearted } talk with her.
But she just said { warmly ### nervously ### firmly ### coldly } , When you grow up, you will know that I have done good for you.
I can't { talk ### communicate ### stay ### sit } with her.

If she scolds but cannot help, she clearly knows study is important but does not know how to study { fast ### busily ### effectively ### hard } .
Communicating with her was { difficult ### funny ### simple ### interesting } because everything she wanted to say to me had to be written on a notepad.

Hearing that, the patient gave me a { surprise ### stare ### smile ### whistle } and a hug.
Day by day, I built her { future ### strength ### hope ### confidence } by walking around the floor with her.

whether the { situation ### choice ### chance ### cause } he faced was positive or negative.
The friend { carried ### bought ### hid ### prepared } the for the king.
Apparently, he had made a(n) { decision ### mistake ### effort ### attempt } in the preparation of the shotgun.
The king { shot ### inspected ### ran ### frightened } and it took his thumb away.
When { describing ### improving ### examining ### correcting } the situation, the friend said as usual , That is good!
The king answered, No, this is not good. He put his friend in { forest ### prison ### hospital ### palace } .
One year later, the king was { fighting ### struggling ### hunting ### reading } in a forest, where caught him .
One year later, the king was hunting in a forest, where { guided ### chose ### challenged ### caught } him .
They tied his hands, and piled up the { wood ### leaves ### stone ### sand } .
When they came closer to the fire they noticed the king didn't have the { hand ### thumb ### friend ### weapon } .
As they never ate whoever had a part of his { memory ### thought ### body ### reputation } missing, they set the king free.
When the king arrived at his palace, he { remembered ### discovered ### recorded ### doubted } the incident about his thumb and was filled with for the treatment given to his friend.
 { Suddenly ### Indirectly ### Frequently ### Immediately } , he paid a visit to his friend.
You were { generous ### polite ### right ### smart } , said the king.
I'm { satisfied ### worried ### lucky ### sorry } that I sent you to prison for such a long period.
It was my { right ### fault ### conclusion ### sorrow } .
No, the friend said, that was a good decision. What do you { mean ### find ### suggest ### explain } by that?
The friend answered, Remember that if I was not in prison, { finally ### certainly ### nearly ### luckily } I would be with you in the hunt.
Do not { imagine ### suspect ### judge ### admire } facts or events by the immediate results!
I can vaguely remember the brightness of { sky ### cloud ### sunshine ### mist } and what color1 red is.
It would be { helpful ### wonderful ### hopeful ### successful } to see again, but a(n) disaster can do strange things to people .
It would be wonderful to see again, but a(n) { disaster ### environment ### incident ### wonder } can do strange things to people .
I don't mean I would { manage ### try ### want ### prefer } to go without my eyes.
I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate more what I had { lost ### left ### used ### cared } .
My parents and my teachers saw something in me ----- a { purpose ### potential ### pressure ### preparation } to live ---- which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with left .
My parents and my teachers saw something in me ----- a prefer to live ---- which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with { energy ### happiness ### luck ### blindness } .
The { hardest ### dullest ### simplest ### easiest } lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself.
I am not talking about simply the kind of { self-respect ### self-control ### self-confidence ### self-defence } that helps me down so unfamiliar staircase alone.
I { think ### consider ### guess ### mean } something bigger than that : a confidence that I am, despite being blindness , a real, positive person ; that there is a special place where I can make myself fit .

 { Later ### Soon ### Once ### Then } a man gave me an indoor baseball.
I thought he was laughing at me and I was { worried ### encouraged ### shocked ### hurt } .
Take with you, he urged me, and roll it around. The words { stuck ### impressed ### occupied ### held } in my head.
Roll it around! By rolling the ball I could { see ### hear ### notice ### observe } where it went.
This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought { important ### unimportant ### possible ### impossible } before playing baseball.
At Philadelphia's Overbrook School for the Blind, I { invented ### discovered ### instructed ### directed } a successful variation of baseball.
I had to be clear about my { experience ### advantages ### knowledge ### limitation } .
It was no good crying for something that I knew at the start was { hardly ### wildly ### highly ### deeply } out of reach because that only invited bitterness of failure.
I would fail in something anyway, { so ### for ### but ### and } on the average I made progress.
He had { taken ### held ### brought ### drawn } $10,000 from the bank in town.
Mr. Green told him to get on and continued his way. { As ### Since ### Then ### Because } he talked to the man, he learned that he had just broken out of prison .
Mr. Green told him to get on and continued his way. As he talked to the man, he { recognized ### learned ### supposed ### expected } that he had just broken out of prison .
Mr. Green was very afraid at the { sight ### idea ### touch ### thought } of the money.
Suddenly he saw a police-car and had a { fast ### bright ### strange ### practical } idea.
He { put ### got ### took ### had } on speed and drove as quikly as possible.
After a mile the police-car passed him and ordered him to { go ### stop ### stand ### park } .
Mr. Green hoped to tell him about the trouble but the man put a gun to Mr. Green's { head ### shoulder ### back ### neck } .
The policeman said he wanted Mr. Green's name and { number ### home ### place ### address } amd Mr. Green obeyed.
The policeman wrote it down in his notebook and put it in his { car ### pocket ### hand ### trousers } .
You { shall ### will ### would ### need } appear at the police station, he said, Then he talked to Mr .
Green about { careful ### fast ### careless ### dangerous } driving .
He had given { out ### away ### up ### in } all hope of his $10,000, but as he reached a more lonely part, the robber said he wanted to get out , Mr .
Green stopped and the man said , Thank you , You've been { kind ### polite ### known ### necessary } to me .
And he handed Mr. Green the policeman's { gun ### pen ### money ### notebook } , which was stolen while the policeman was talking to Mr. Green.
The eagle's { home ### nest ### family ### hotel } contained four large eagle eggs.
One day an earthquake rocked the mountain, { guiding ### blowing ### inviting ### causing } one of the eggs to roll down the mountain to a chicken farm, which was in the valley below .
One day an earthquake rocked the mountain, causing one of the eggs to roll down the mountain { on ### over ### to ### past } a chicken farm, which was in the valley below .
The chickens knew that they must { protect ### punish ### introduce ### share } and care for the eagle's egg, so an old hen to to hatch and raise the large egg .
The chickens knew that they must causing and care for the eagle's egg, so an old hen { offered ### regretted ### tried ### turned } to hatch and raise the large egg .
One day, the egg hatched and a beautiful { egg ### hen ### eagle ### chicken } was born.
Sadly, however, the eagle was raised to be a(n) { chicken ### eagle ### hero ### fool } .
Soon, the eagle believed he was { something ### nothing ### anything ### everything } more than a chicken.
The eagle { loved ### hated ### disliked ### appreciated } his home and family, but his spirit cried out for more.
While playing a game on the farm one day, the eagle looked at the skies above and { heard ### recognized ### respected ### noticed } a group of eagles soaring in the skies.
Oh, the eagle cried, I wish I could soar { like ### over ### for ### against } those birds.
You are a chicken and chickens do not { dance ### soar ### sing ### swim } .
The eagle { approached ### avoided ### continued ### considered } staring at his real family up above , noticed that he could be with them high in the sky .
The eagle loved staring at his real family up above , { promising ### proving ### dreaming ### believing } that he could be with them high in the sky .
Each time the eagle wanted to let his { suggestion ### advantage ### discovery ### dream } be known, he was told it couldn't be done.
That is { why ### what ### how ### when } the eagle learned to believe.
Slowly, the eagle { went ### enjoyed ### stopped ### began } his dreaming and continued to live his life like a chicken.
 { Happily ### Finally ### Quickly ### Probably } , after a long life as a chicken, the eagle passed away .
You will become what you believe you are; so if you ever dream of becoming an eagle, { stick ### have ### follow ### remember } your dreams, not the words of a chicken.
I live in a big city. It's noisy and dirty and I got very { angry ### surprised ### tiring ### tired } .
At the weekends I like to leave the city and get some { warm ### cool ### cold ### fresh } air and a good rest .
A few weeks ago I decided to go to see my { comrades ### friends ### parents ### hometown } I was really looking forward to it.
My parents live a long way { away ### here ### there ### far } .
In the middle of the { day ### night ### journey ### road } it began to rain.
The road became very { narrow ### wet ### dirty ### dry } and it was difficult to drive.
We arrived home just after midnight, feeling very { happy ### excited ### tired ### thirsty } .
The next { morning ### day ### afternoon ### evening } it was still raining.
James took his { clothes ### car ### books ### machine } to a garage which was very good.
In the afternoon the { car ### clothes ### weather ### work } improved, we wanted to go for a drive .
In the afternoon the weather improved, we wanted to go for a { drive ### look ### trip ### walk } .
That was no good. Their car didn't { move ### run ### begin ### work } .
We rang up the garage. Oh, They said, Your car { mustn't ### couldn't ### wouldn't ### won't } be ready till tomorrow.
So it wasn't { interesting ### necessary ### possible ### wonderful } to go for a drive.
When we didn't agree { about ### over ### for ### with } a word we looked for a dictionary.
It wasn't there. { Luckily ### Suddenly ### Finally ### Quickly } my mother remembered, I lent it to your sister.
The word game wasn't any good { for ### in ### with ### without } a dictionary.
On Sunday my mother dropped a heavy box on her { foot ### leg ### head ### floor } and we had to hire a without to take her to hospital .
On Sunday my mother dropped a heavy box on her Suddenly and we had to hire a { truck ### taxi ### bike ### bus } to take her to hospital .
On the market, we { see ### touch ### sell ### compare } to find the best ones.
In the classroom teachers compare their students to the { mature ### new ### model ### overseas } .
And parents compare their child to his or her peers to { get ### use ### share ### explain } an idea of what is normal .
 { Therefore ### However ### Otherwise ### Besides } , comparisons of any kind come with a sting for everyone.
When parents make it clear to anyone that their child is { harmful ### superior ### responsible ### thankful } to all other children in all ways, they put their child under pressure .
When parents make it clear to anyone that their child is superior to all other children in all ways, they put their child under { pressure ### control ### discussion ### consideration } .
Some children will obey when they are pressured to { express ### prove ### satisfy ### create } their parents' need for perfection ; others may pressure , trying to be just like any other kid, or, better still, to be just who they are .
Some children will obey when they are pressured to superior their parents' need for perfection ; others may { disappear ### wait ### resist ### rest } , trying to be just like any other kid, or, better still, to be just who they are .
In other { cases ### words ### ways ### nations } , parents who compare their child to other children might end up pressure their child is somehow deficient .
In other superior , parents who compare their child to other children might end up { denying ### deciding ### predicting ### concluding } their child is somehow deficient .
And, again, they pressure their child to be { honest ### good ### patient ### polite } enough.
A most disturbing { process ### consequence ### purpose ### method } of all this comparing is that it pushes children into the destructive world of competition.
In a { traditional ### scientific ### political ### competitive } culture, a child is told that it isn't enough to be good---he or she must resist others, writes Alfie Kohn, a parenting expert .
In a satisfy culture, a child is told that it isn't enough to be good---he or she must { defeat ### accept ### recognize ### choose } others, writes Alfie Kohn, a parenting expert .
According to Kohn, research doesn't { test ### challenge ### support ### change } the theory that competition brings success.
One after another, researchers have concluded that children don't learn better { since ### until ### when ### unless } education is changed into a competitive struggle.
Competition prevents a child's ability { losing ### progressing ### showing ### reducing } not only educationally but socially, too.
They will need role models to { guide ### force ### invite ### expect } them.
In the { charge ### absence ### respect ### presence } of my father who died when I was six, Steve gave me important instructions that helped me grow into an adult.
For example, Steve taught me to face the { advantages ### reasons ### realities ### results } of my behavior.
Once when I returned in { surprise ### tears ### joy ### smiles } from a Saturday baseball game, it was Steve who took the time to ask me what happened .
Once when I returned in tears from a Saturday baseball game, it was Steve who { took ### spent ### cost ### paid } the time to ask me what happened .
When I { insisted ### introduced ### declared ### explained } that my baseball had flown through Mrs Holt's basement window, took the glass with a crash, Steve encouraged me to explained to her .
When I tears that my baseball had flown through Mrs Holt's basement window, { injuring ### damaging ### destroying ### breaking } the glass with a crash, Steve encouraged me to explained to her .
When I tears that my baseball had flown through Mrs Holt's basement window, took the glass with a crash, Steve encouraged me to { Apologize ### recognize ### send ### offer } to her .
After all, I { could ### must ### would ### should } not have played in the path between buildings.
 { Since ### Although ### Because ### But } my knees shocked as I explained, I explained to pay for the window if she would return my ball .
 took my knees shocked as I explained, I { refused ### offered ### afforded ### managed } to pay for the window if she would return my ball .
I also learned from Steve that { personal ### valuable ### public ### whole } property is a sacred thing.
After I found a silver pen in my fifthgrade classroom, I wanted to { save ### keep ### pick ### return } it, but Steve explained that it might be important to someone else in spite of the fact that it had little value.
Yet of all the { information ### explanation ### opinions ### instructions } Steve gave me, his respect for Apologize is the most vivid in my mind .
Yet of all the breaking Steve gave me, his respect for { life ### people ### family ### things } is the most vivid in my mind .
 { Proud ### Encouraged ### Relaxed ### Excited } with my accuracy, I screamed to Steve to come from the house to have a look.
I shall never forget the { way ### time ### place ### scene } he stood for a long moment and stared at the bird.
Did it { affect ### interrupt ### hurt ### fight } you first, Mark?
I really felt terrible then, but that moment { stands ### reaches ### turns ### Holds } out as the most important lesson my brother taught me.
She was a small woman, { pretending ### designing ### waiting ### trying } to catch the bus at a deserted bus stop.
I just want to see what it will be like at the { stop ### road ### place ### terminal } .
You know I { lost ### made ### abandoned ### ruined } it all.
We were going to get { paid ### married ### promoted ### deserted } after four years' ups and downs.
And he came one day, with nothing to say, just to show me a { flower ### gift ### ring ### necklace } on his finger.
The woman gave a { sigh ### whistle ### reply ### touch } of sympathy.
Now, do you want to { tell ### hear ### cover ### make } my life story while we're waiting for the bus?
the woman asked me in a low voice. I gave her a { blank ### cold ### innocent ### fresh } look and nodded my head.
The moment we arrived, he left us { out ### off ### over ### behind } with a wish for good luck, to seek his own happiness .
The moment we arrived, he left us behind with a wish for good luck, to { rescue ### seek ### share ### own } his own happiness .
Yet how could I { shelter ### educate ### command ### attend } my three children in a strange land, with no money, no relatives and a seek heart ?
Yet how could I behind my three children in a strange land, with no money, no relatives and a { delighted ### frightened ### torn ### excited } heart ?
However, the kids were scared and they cried { deliberately ### wildly ### causally ### occasionally } .
Their desperation suddenly woke me up from a long nightmare. How { curious ### proud ### brave ### selfish } I was!
She continued, I hugged them tightly, feeling a sudden strength { inside ### alongside ### beneath ### over } me.
Then, I did all the things that brought me { also ### almost ### even ### still } a penny.
Later, I found a man with the same pain. I feel { life ### career ### friendship ### money } has paid me off.
Why don't you get cheered up and enjoy the { conversation ### vehicle ### scenery ### love } on the way?
The reason I can remember the date so well is that being sick is what { brought ### resulted ### followed ### caused } me to choose my future wife.
She was just a good friend, but because she came over to my apartment, brought me medicine, and made me breakfast, I thought for the first time what a super wife she will { develop ### get ### become ### prove } for someone.
After that we became even better friends, but still { much ### more ### less ### no } thought of marriage.
A few months later I was going to { take ### give ### hand ### continue } a new job in the Atlanta area, so Cathy helped me pack up boxes to get ready to leave.
We { spent ### had ### took ### cost } a great time that day and had lunch together.
Near the end of that day I { noticed ### observed ### looked ### watched } a few tears in Cathy's eyes, so I asked what was wrong .
Near the end of that day I noticed a few tears in Cathy's eyes, so I asked what was { right ### terrible ### wrong ### awful } .
She said, I don't know if I can live { with ### without ### by ### on } you, you are my best friend.
I said, I know, I've been thinking the { different ### difficult ### similar ### same } thing.
We have had our { hard ### happy ### wonderful ### common } times, as many others have had, but we are still best friends!
 { Unless ### Until ### When ### Though } I get to the family unit in my Health class and we talk about hard .
 same I get to the family unit in my Health class and we talk about { health ### marriage ### exercise ### hobby } .
My students seem to love it because they learn that { taking ### supporting ### gaining ### giving } , sharing and caring about others is all that really hard in life, and that looks, money and other things are not important .
My students seem to love it because they learn that same , sharing and caring about others is all that really { matters ### works ### helps ### needs } in life, and that looks, money and other things are not important .
 { In ### By ### On ### Off } the way, my wife is 12 years younger than me, and she is beautiful.
We have 2 beautiful children, but we still have dates on { any ### some ### all ### every } weekend.
When you're a preteen, a huge problem might be that you just have to have a new rock-rap CD, { or ### so ### but ### for } your parents won't give you the money for it.
I thought life was so { unfair ### uncomfortable ### unbelievable ### uncertain } when things like this happened-----until September 11, 2001.
As soon as I got home and for weeks before, I saw the disaster { happen ### occur ### strike ### unfold } on TV.
Seeing the innocent people running for their { lives ### families ### houses ### friends } as the debris started coming down the fire and smoke rose out of the buildings brought tears to my eyes .
Seeing the innocent people running for their lives as the debris started coming down the fire and smoke rose out of the { curtains ### buildings ### gates ### bedrooms } brought tears to my eyes .
I couldn't help imagining what the people on the { seats ### planes ### corners ### streets } and in the buildings were thinking and going through, not buildings what was going on .
I couldn't help imagining what the people on the lives and in the buildings were thinking and going through, not { believing ### thinking ### caring ### knowing } what was going on .
I admired the courage of the firefighters who rushed in and risked their own lives to { join ### save ### meet ### calm } others.
It tore my heart apart to watch the { puzzled ### severe ### dirty ### desperate } looks on the faces of so many people who didn't know if their loved ones were dead or alive while planes in all the debris .
It tore my heart apart to watch the buildings looks on the faces of so many people who didn't know if their loved ones were dead or alive while { hidden ### found ### trapped ### placed } in all the debris .
Then it { hit ### surprised ### rewarded ### told } me: All my life I had thought mainly of myself.
A feeling of coldness { cooled ### dropped ### ran ### passed } down my back, and I cried just thinking of the possibility that it could have easily knowing to my family .
A feeling of coldness planes down my back, and I cried just thinking of the possibility that it could have easily { happened ### compared ### related ### turned } to my family .
I began to evaluate what a real { relationship ### problem ### need ### fate } in life was.
This disaster { persuaded ### reminded ### taught ### informed } me that awful things can happen to anyone at any time.
Now when my mom or dad or sister go somewhere, even if it's just { to ### in ### at ### on } the store, I try to remember to tell them that I love them because I know there is a desperate that I may never tell them that trapped .

Now when my mom or dad or sister go somewhere, even if it's just save the store, I try to remember to tell them that I love them because I know there is a desperate that I may never tell them that { ever ### once ### enough ### again } .
Not getting a new CD is not going to { end ### save ### spare ### break } my life.
But losing someone I love would { rather ### truly ### probably ### frequently } make my life miserable.
a girl asked me one day. Nobody had ever { faced ### guessed ### asked ### imagined } before.
Later that day at home, I began to { consider ### brush ### cover ### appreciate } my teeth again.
Of course, Mom { admitted ### noticed ### controlled ### changed } everything .
Let's be { friendly ### lovely ### honest ### helpful } though, she said.
There is beauty in differences. Her { words ### jokes ### dreams ### acts } made me consider my teeth seriously.
It is part of my { ability ### decision ### goal ### identity } Nowadays many people do ridiculous things to realize their dream of perfection.
The { possibility ### purpose ### truth ### choice } is that no one is perfect.
When all potential for ugliness is removed, so is all of the potential for { courage ### wisdom ### kindness ### beauty } So if that girl ever asked about my teeth again I would truthfully answer .

Twentyfive years later another group of graduate students were given the job of { testing ### explaining ### finding ### making } the previous prediction.
They went back to the { special ### same ### only ### lonely } area.
Some of the boys--now { workers ### teenagers ### men ### students } --were still there,a few had died and some has moved away.
But they managed to { record ### find ### know ### trace } 180 of the original 200.They found that only four of the boys had ever been sent to prison.
Why was it that these men,who had lived in a breeding place of { disease ### magic ### disaster ### crime } ,had such surprisingly testing record ?
Why was it that these men,who had lived in a breeding place of prison ,had such surprisingly { reliable ### good ### detailed ### bad } record ?
The researchers were { normally ### gradually ### continually ### nearly } told .
Well,there was a { teacher ### doctor ### director ### friend } .
They investigated { too ### instead ### already ### further } and found that in 78 percent of the men it was the same woman .
They investigated same and found that in 78 percent of the { cases ### manners ### states ### ways } it was the same woman .
The researchers went to the teacher,now living in a home for { determined ### well-known ### retired ### skilled } teacher .
How had she had this remarkable { technique ### influence ### courage ### advantage } on that group of children ?
Could she give them any reason why these boys { .remembered ### rewarded ### treated ### frightened } her ?
And then,59 thinking back over the years,she said musingly ,more to herself than to her questioners, I { persuaded ### reminded ### loved ### taught } these boys.
Just as we had { planned ### hoped ### heard ### thought } , my good friends and I were in the same class, including Derek, a boy I have known for a long time .

For the first few months, Derek hoped his Maple Leaf jersey to school almost every day, because that was his { attractive ### extra ### favorite ### useless } National Hockey League (NHL) team uniform .

He spent all of fall and most of winter hoped soccer with other guys, guarding the net { even ### then ### only ### yet } in a big snowstorm .
Then, a few weeks before school ended for the Christmas holiday, Derek { liked ### stopped ### considered ### disliked } coming to school.
I didn't think much of it and just kept { free ### busy ### amused ### tired } preparing for final exams.
On December 19, 2013, our class was { normal ### quiet ### excited ### confused } because it was the second-to-last day of school before vacation.
Then as we settled down into craft making, game-playing and chatting mode, our English teacher walked into the { room ### school ### classroom ### office } .
Her nose was bright red, as if she had been { crying ### shouting ### freezing ### walking } .
She was { attracted ### caught ### misunderstood ### followed } by a few people carrying Derek's belongings.
She moved to the front of the class and we { slowly ### necessarily ### immediately ### certainly } fell silent, wondering what could have stopped .
She moved to the front of the class and we even fell silent, wondering what could have { disappeared ### happened ### arrived ### waited } .
I have some bad news about Derek, said the principal with great { patience ### help ### courage ### sadness } .

He was a(n) stopped boy, for he saved a little girl from a rushing car, for which Derek was in a { better ### good ### bad ### nice } condition .
A silence fell on the class. No one { moved ### opened ### cried ### Disappeared } .
Knowing this, one year I { decided ### urged ### struggled ### declared } to reach for something special just for Mike.
The { story ### Christmas ### inspiration ### affection } came in an unusual way.
Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, attended a wrestling match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church shortly { after ### before ### during ### on } Christmas.
These youngsters' sneakers were in { ruins ### styles ### chains ### rags } and the shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together , compared to our boys' gold uniforms and shoes .
These youngsters' sneakers were in rags and the shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them { apart ### forever ### together ### around } , compared to our boys' gold uniforms and shoes .
Mike, seated beside me, { nodded ### shook ### waved ### turned } his head sadly, I wish just one of them could have won, he said.
That's when the idea for his { word ### note ### envelop ### present } came.
That afternoon, I went to a local sports store and bought some wrestling helmets and { shoes ### shoestrings ### gifts ### sports } and sent them anonymously to the inner-city present .
That afternoon, I went to a local sports store and bought some wrestling helmets and shook and sent them anonymously to the inner-city { house ### school ### church ### store } .
On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note { inside ### outside ### between ### nearby } telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me.
For each Christmas, I { refused ### imagined ### followed ### missed } the tradition.
It was always the { best ### first ### worst ### last } thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their unwrapped new toys, would stand with wide-eyed church as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to exhibit its inside .

As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the envelope { once ### never ### ever ### seldom } lost its temptation.
We lost Mike due to cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was in { anger ### shock ### sadness ### annoyance } .
But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning, three more { attended ### entered ### placed ### joined } it.
Each of our { grandchildren ### children ### friends ### relatives } , had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad.
The tradition has grown and someday will expand further with our grandchildren standing around the tree { watching ### singing ### smiling ### crying } as their fathers take down the envelope with expectation.

Then one day,several weeks later,he was walking past an old house when he heard a { strange ### sweet ### loud ### familiar } sound .
He looked up and there was the { cat ### sparrow ### basket ### stick } , sitting on the gate .
The sparrow gave the old man a gold { coin ### watch ### ring ### cup } it had found in the house .

If you have found { food ### treasure ### rooms ### plant } ,bring it along and I`ll spend it all on you.
she promised. The sparrow brought her an old { bowl ### box ### chair ### basket } with the help of its friends .
The basket was { covered ### empty ### big ### small } but the woman did not wait to find out what was in it .
She grabbed it and ran, { pleased ### afraid ### anxious ### hopeful } that the sparrow would follow and take up residence in her house again .
The moment she reached home,she { laid ### broke ### hid ### opened } the basket,expecting it to be filled to the eaves with gold and silver .

I was at the funeral of my { neighbor ### sister ### mother ### aunt } .
The hurt was so intense , and I found it hard to { stand ### imagine ### breathe ### explain } at times.
Suddenly, I heard a { box ### door ### bottle ### chair } open and slam shut at the back of the church.
Quick { claps ### songs ### steps ### noises } hurried along the floor.
A young man looked around in a { mood ### row ### rush ### mess } and then sat next to me.
His eyes were full of tears. I'm { full ### angry ### anxious ### late } , he explained, though no explanation was necessary .
His eyes were full of tears. I'm late , he explained, though no explanation was { necessary ### impossible ### natural ### uncertain } .
After several eulogies , he leaned over and commented, Why do they keep { questioning ### naming ### calling ### asking } Mary by the name of 'Margaret'?
Because that was her name, Margaret. Never Mary, I { whispered ### shouted ### reported ### cried } .
Her name is Mary, Mary Peters. That isn't { who ### when ### where ### why } this is, I replied.
I believe you're at the { right ### same ### different ### wrong } funeral, sir.
The solemnness of the occasion { worked ### matched ### tied ### mixed } with the realization of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as wrong .
The solemnness of the occasion who with the realization of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as { tear ### fighting ### singing ### laughter } .
I peeked at the misguided man seated beside me. He was laughing, { though ### yet ### too ### still } .
At the { middle ### second ### final ### first } Aman , we darted out a door and into the parking lot.
I do believe we'll be the { talk ### word ### eye ### idea } of the town, he smiled.
He said his name was Rick and that { although ### if ### since ### before } he had missed his aunt's funeral, he asked me out for a cup of coffee.
That afternoon began a lifelong { journey ### waiting ### dream ### thought } for me with this man who attended the wrong funeral.
A year after our meeting, we were { protected ### married ### improved ### placed } at a country church.
Whenever anyone asks us how we { lived ### met ### grew ### stayed } , Rick tells them, Her mother and my aunt Mary introduced us.
In a(n) { destroyed ### old ### nice ### new } house, they found a woman.
Through the ruins, they could see her last { debate ### action ### guide ### quarrel } .
Being on her knees, the upper part of her body was { forward ### western ### up ### straight } , with her hands on the ground to support her body .
Being on her knees, the upper part of her body was forward , with her hands on the ground to { lower ### rise ### support ### carry } her body .
It looked strange because she was bent out of { sight ### question ### job ### shape } .
The leader came to the body, reached out his hands under the woman, feeling and touching, and then he shouted loudly, There is someone, a { teenager ### citizen ### baby ### fellow } , still living.
Through some effort, rescuers { cleaned ### added ### looked ### called } up the bricks covering her body.
Under her body was her baby, who was { gathered ### packed ### locked ### dressed } Because he was well protected by the mother's body, he was cleaned safe .
Under her body was her baby, who was baby Because he was well protected by the mother's body, he was { totally ### differently ### widely ### narrowly } safe .
He was sleeping when the rescuers carried him out, and his lovely and peaceful face { encouraged ### delighted ### warned ### warmed } everyone around him.
The doctor, along with the rescue team, opened the { blanket ### brick ### overcoat ### quilt } to check if the baby was all right, and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt.
A written message was there, My dear baby, if you live, don't { remember ### know ### forget ### keep } how much I love you.
It was a warm March evening,and I'd just taken a seat on the bus that would take me home.It was nearly 6:00 PM,but the bus was not yet full and the driver gave no { answer ### agreement ### sign ### meaning } that he intended to start the bus.
She was crying.Not speaking to anyone in particular,she { tearfully ### excitedly ### helplessly ### proudly } told her story.
On the way to the terminal ,a thief had { got ### stole ### pulled ### caught } one of her bags .
The other half was hidden under her blouse, so she { surprisingly ### peacefully ### naturally ### fortunately } still had some money left .
After a few minutes, all seats were { had ### crowded ### full ### taken } .
When he came to the old man's seat,he became { conscious ### suspicious ### curious ### anxious } and asked the old man whether he had any money .
The old man { realized ### pretended ### admitted ### remembered } that he did not .
Upon hearing this,the bus conductor { asked ### ordered ### led ### begged } the old man to get off the bus .
The old man was almost in tears as he begged the bus conductor to let him take that bus { so ### until ### if ### when } he could get home before dark .
The bus driver approached the old man,and repeated the conductor's { arrangement ### command ### advice ### decision } to get off the bus .
Well, that's no { good ### sense ### reason ### doubt } to throw him off the bus, she insisted.Then she said, How much is his fare?
She { picked ### removed ### touched ### reached } inside her blouse, took out her remaining money,and handed the fare to the bus conductor .
She reached inside her blouse, took out her { left ### saving ### borrowed ### remaining } money,and handed the fare to the bus conductor .
All eyes turned { in ### to ### down ### on } the woman,who,just minutes before,had been crying over the money she'd lost.
She rode the rest of the way home { owning ### wearing ### hating ### losing } a Mona Lisa smile of peace and grace,and the money she'd lost to was forgotten .
She rode the rest of the way home remaining a Mona Lisa smile of peace and grace,and the money she'd lost { earlier ### sooner ### later ### former } was forgotten .
On the road of life,the politeness and smiles of { customers ### friends ### strangers ### conductors } can lighten our loads and lift our spirits.How much sweeter the journey when we make it a little smoother and richer for others !
The weather had been dark and rainy, and I just didn't feel so { special ### positive ### nervous ### proud } .
As I was sitting at my desk, I { explained ### complained ### remembered ### informed } it was the birthday of a dear long-time friend -- a single, middle-aged woman who has devoted the past 30 years to nursing and loves her work .
As I was sitting at my desk, I remembered it was the birthday of a dear long-time friend -- a single, middle-aged woman who has devoted the past 30 years to nursing and loves her { family ### training ### school ### work } .
Knowing that she doesn't have family in town, I { decided ### continued ### agreed ### started } to give her a call.
Sure enough, she was on B-shift, { surprised ### disappointed ### bored ### prepared } to work late into the evening, and wouldn't have decided of a birthday this year .

As always, work , she sounded cheerful and was happy that I { admitted ### called ### succeeded ### apologized } .
After I hung up, I couldn't { experience ### imagine ### shake ### understand } the feeling that she would really appreciate a little attention on her special day.
 { Almost ### Even ### Never ### Still } feeling a little gloomy myself, I tried to put it out of my mind, but as the day passed I couldn't shake the thought.
I { luckily ### finally ### unhappily ### hardly } gave in, and that evening set off to the hospital with a card, a cheese cake, and some balloons.
My friend's grateful smile and joyful surprise { convinced ### advised ### promised ### reminded } me I'd done the right thing and were a generous however for the little effort it had taken .
My friend's grateful smile and joyful surprise much me I'd done the right thing and were a generous { response ### contribution ### reward ### share } for the little effort it had taken .
When I got home, I realized that not only had I cheered up a { careless ### lonely ### weak ### good } friend on her birthday, but my own gloomy feelings had also disappeared.
Making her day had { found ### taken ### created ### made } my own!
Isn't that the way it is { when ### where ### why ### how } we take the time and make the shake to do something for someone else ?
Isn't that the way it is called we take the time and make the { suggestion ### friend ### effort ### call } to do something for someone else ?
It's like the little saying, Loving kindness is twice blessed; it blesses him who gives, and him who { tries ### receives ### expects ### cares } .
Life constantly presents us with { opportunities ### dreams ### choices ### regrets } to take an extra step or do a kind deed that will make a difference to someone .

Engaged in work, Rose aged 27, reached the destination hurriedly to meet visitors : her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown . But as she hurried down the underground stairs,she started to feel { proud ### excited ### dizzy ### disappointed } .
When she got to the platform,Rose felt weak and tired--maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before,she thought.She rested herself { against ### by ### near ### around } a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away,Frank,43 and his girlfriend, Jennifer found a spot close to { how ### which ### where ### when } the front of the train would stop.
They were deep in { argument ### conclusion ### expectation ### discussion } about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, { followed ### accompanied ### caught ### controlled } by someone yelling, Oh,my God,she fell in!
Frank didn't hesitate.He { looked ### jumped ### turned ### fell } down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails.
No! Not you! his girlfriend { screamed ### cried ### shouted ### stopped } after him.
She was { about ### going ### right ### willing } to be alarmed .
By the time Frank reached Rose,he could feel the tracks { moving ### damaging ### cracking ### shaking } and see the light coming .
The train was about 20 { minutes ### seconds ### miles ### moments } from the station.
It was { easy ### impossible ### hard ### possible } to lift her .
But he managed to raise her four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grip and { push ### drag ### held ### took } her away from the edge .
That was where Rose briefly regained { life ### consciousness ### help ### thoughts } ,felt herself being pulled along the ground, and someone else holding her drag .
That was where Rose briefly regained hard ,felt herself being pulled along the ground, and someone else holding her { body ### purse ### hand ### shoes } .
A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help { press ### wipe ### stop ### keep } the blood pouring from her head .
 { And ### But ### So ### Since } she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials { actually ### slowly ### soon ### unnecessarily } arrived,and Frank told what had happened .
Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown---just as he had been seconds after the { risk ### rescue ### acquaintance ### appointment } which made her think about her stop at the time .

My parents were a team, as if they were one person. Sure, they argued , but undoubtedly any { opinions ### worries ### disagreements ### ways } would be solved .

They began their married life argued , but they worked hard and, { after ### for ### during ### over } the years built a very successful business .
They had strengths and weaknesses, but so { long ### far ### good ### well } as they worked together, you never saw weaknesses, just strengths .
The biggest { lesson ### experience ### memory ### impression } about love and marriage my parents taught us kids was how to talk about your partner.
Have you ever heard husbands and wives make { unnecessary ### unkind ### unlikely ### unsuitable } remarks about their partners?
Sure, they are only kidding or maybe they are not. But words { help ### treat ### matter ### work } .
Dad always speaks of mom in positive words, { so ### it ### such ### as } does she of him.
Dad { talked ### listened ### lied ### responded } , Well, they were right there with you before you had any money, it's a unkind to do anything for them you possibly can .
Dad lesson , Well, they were right there with you before you had any money, it's a { pity ### shame ### pleasure ### chance } to do anything for them you possibly can .
The crew boss { said ### tried ### asked ### questioned } one more time, And they'll take that as far as they can, huh?
I'll do anything to make her happy. I tried not to { shout ### cry ### forget ### laugh } .
My parents are retired and still enjoying their life together, just { staying ### hanging ### setting ### running } out, reading, shopping.
Throughout the years, { if ### though ### whenever ### however } Mom would remind me I should be responded for someone to get married to, I'd say, Ma, I have plenty of time .
Throughout the years, as Mom would remind me I should be { thinking ### desiring ### designing ### looking } for someone to get married to, I'd say, Ma, I have plenty of time .
She'd { seriously ### jokingly ### angrily ### happily } reply I don't have 'that' much time .
Dad would then look at me and say, Hey, you { take ### have ### spend ### waste } all the time you need.
If you marry someone just { what ### like ### never ### half } the woman your mother is, you'll have a great life.
But as I built strength, my friends { encouraged ### forbade ### forced ### warned } me to step up my training and try some longer trips, The first one to come along was a 150-mile trip, the MS-150, an annual event that raises money to fight AIDS .
But as I built strength, my friends encouraged me to step up my training and try some longer trips, The first one to come along was a 150-mile trip, the MS-150, an annual { accident ### event ### incident ### affair } that raises money to fight AIDS .
When I registered,the idea seemed fantastic and I trained with { care ### ease ### enthusiasm ### difficulty } .
However,as the time for the ride approached,my selfdoubts { achieved ### gained ### progressed ### advanced } beyond my endurance .
I { still ### even ### rather ### then } wanted to raise money for the charity,but I didn't really want to bike all those miles for two days straight .
The ride began on a beautiful Sunday morning in the Georgia countryside,and for the first few hours I felt { nervous ### disappointed ### wonderful ### refreshed } .
This was just the experience I had { assumed ### appreciated ### admired ### imagined } ,and my spirits were high .
 { But ### Therefore ### Meanwhile ### Moreover } by the end of the day,I felt tired out.
If the body is { opposite ### connected ### exposed ### equal } to the mind,here was evidence.
Every { cause ### reason ### excuse ### effect } my brain pushed out seemed to travel right down to my legs.
I can't handle this became a leg cramp ,and Everyone else is a better rider translated into { holding ### saving ### catching ### shortness } of breath.
I was sure I'd have to { quit ### continue ### insist ### fade } .
Then in the distance,I saw a lone woman riding very slowly { on ### against ### down ### over } the bright red sun.
I { observed ### watched ### noticed ### overlooked } that the person looked different in some way,but I couldn't tell why.
So I pushed myself to catch up .There she was,riding along slowly but { steadily ### abruptly ### closely ### narrowly } ,with a slight and determined smile on her face and she had only one leg.
My focus changed in that instant. For a whole day I'd been { trusting ### doubting ### cheating ### fighting } my body.
But now I knew it wasn't the body,but the { strength ### honesty ### will ### power } that would help me reach my goal.
I never saw the one-legged biker again,but I pushed on without { struggling ### arguing ### discussing ### complaining } ,knowing she was out there with me somewhere.
And at the end of the day,still feeling { strong ### weak ### healthy ### spiritless } ,I completed the 150mile trip.

In addition, researchers weak that the problem may result in a wrong body image---the ideal of female beauty of being very { fat ### thin ### healthy ### weak } .
I've { enjoyed ### found ### discussed ### imagined } these, he said, handing me a bag.
She would have wanted you to { show ### sell ### use ### have } them.
I opened the bag to find dozens of { letters ### shells ### cards ### pictures } , each one wrapped in white tissue paper and bearing Mom's handwritten words: Stone Harbor, N.J.--8-98.
They were pretty { common ### lovely ### important ### cheap } , but to Mom, they were evidence of her endlessly magical life.
She was 61 when she collected these shells, already showing { emotion ### mood ### signs ### worries } of the lung disease that would kill her the next year.
We just knew something was { wrong ### stupid ### reliable ### absurd } and Mom needed an adventure.
She { refused ### hated ### appreciated ### suggested } dinner and a movie.
However, two friends and I had { stranger ### better ### simpler ### ridiculous } ideas.
We wanted to take her to Jersey Shore, { while ### although ### because ### unless } my working-class mother had been to the ocean only twice.
She loved the { sky ### trees ### seashore ### fields } .
When I called Mom with our { dreams ### questions ### concerns ### plans } , she was sitting on the couch with her dog Amber on her leg.
When I told her she'd be able to hear the { ocean ### music ### cars ### birds } from her window, she started to cry.
As soon as we got to Stone Harbor, Mom acted like the town mayor , { knowing ### greeting ### helping ### praising } everyone as if they were loyal constituents .
The morning we { left ### met ### waited ### started } , I found her photographing every inch of her bedroom.
I don't even want to { keep ### regret ### forget ### face } this, she said.
Last month, I { rediscovered ### returned ### understood ### received } them.
One by one, the shells are finding a { quiet ### safe ### right ### new } place in my home.
I put them where I'm { unfortunate ### sure ### proud ### sorry } to see them.
They { forbid ### forgive ### remind ### claim } me to live a life like my mother--who never lost her sense of wonder.
As I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I { realized ### understood ### saw ### helped } a little boy, around one and a half to two years old, running freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance .
As I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I saw a little boy, around one and a half to two years old, { marching ### walking ### running ### moving } freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance .
The boy would then fall to the grass, get up, and without { hesitation ### competition ### situation ### motivation } or without looking back at his mother, run as fast as he could, again, still with a smile on his face.
It seemed { everything ### something ### anything ### nothing } had happened!
For kids, { especially ### specially ### generally ### normally } at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a nothing ; instead, they treat it as a learning experience .
For kids, hesitation at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a { success ### failure ### shame ### pity } ; instead, they treat it as a learning experience .
The answer must be that they have not { announced ### abandoned ### assumed ### associated } falling down with the word failure yet, thus they don' t know how to feel the state which accomparues failure.
Therefore, they are not { encouraged ### shocked ### discouraged ### excited } in any way.
Touched as I was by the boy's { faith ### honesty ### persistence ### loyalty } , I was equally touched by the manner in which he ran.
With each attempt, he looked so { upset ### calm ### enthusiastic ### confident } and natural.
No { symbols ### signs ### signals ### marks } of fear and nervousness.
His only aim was to run freely and to do it as { effectively ### imaginatively ### relatively ### negatively } as he could.
He was not looking for { explanation ### approval ### curiosity ### opinion } or was not worrying about whether someone was confident or not .
He was not looking for persistence or was not worrying about whether someone was { listening ### glaring ### watching ### enjoying } or not .
He didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that maybe someone would see him fall ( as there were others in the park apart from him and his mother) and that it would be { embarrassing ### amazing ### confusing ### thrilling } if he did fall.
No, all that { referred ### came ### contributed ### mattered } to him was to accomplish the task or activity at hand to the best of his ability.
I { won ### learned ### made ### knew } a lot from that observation and experience, and have successfully brought that lesson with me in my many pursuits in life.

Gabi has { bought ### exchanged ### collected ### offered } every small gift that the crows have given her,including a tiny silver ball,a blue plastic brick,a small piece of colored glass,and other such things .
Each item is individually wrapped and,they're obviously of great { help ### value ### care ### grief } to Gabi .
This was the { dream ### weather ### result ### day } my father and I had waited so long for, because we had been working towards this race for three years.
They had come { for ### to ### across ### over } me.
I saw worry and { coldness ### astonishment ### excitement ### amusement } on my father's face.
For the first two and a half miles. I felt { proud ### great ### nervous ### afraid } .
The weeks leading up to the race were filled with controlled { programs ### studies ### instructions ### practices } and a strict diet.
My friends hadn't seen me in weeks, but they understood the { sacrifice ### potential ### patience ### attention } required to make my dream a reality.
As in all of my races,I didn't { look ### move ### start ### come } out in the front,I loved the pleasure of passing people as my strength overtook their premature speed.
Neck and neck with one of my greatest competitors, I { should ### could ### must ### need } see the finish line.
I had begun the final dash into { relief ### spirit ### pleasure ### glory } when my knees became weak and my legs gave way.
Nothing I could do would make them { give ### feel ### hold ### add } weight.
 { Where ### Because ### If ### Although } I knew my dreams of victory were destroyed.
With all of the { trust ### emotion ### strength ### confidence } left in me, I got on my hands and knees and crawled , inch by inch, across the finish line.
Voices, both { loud ### foreign ### soft ### firm } and familiar, cheered me on.
They gave me the courage to keep { going ### running ### fighting ### training } until the very end.
There was only one person I wanted to { refer ### talk ### listen ### agree } to.
I whispered, I'm so sorry , Dad, I'm so sorry I { frightened ### disturbed ### disappointed ### bored } you.
Sometimes these things just { develop ### change ### follow ### happen } .
All that matters is that you did your best. But we worked so { late ### hard ### closely ### quickly } .
It wasn't long before my running shoes were back on, marking a { new ### near ### rough ### narrow } path for my journey, I learned that all of the miles, the tears, the sweat, and the pain my dad and I experienced together were not for a race .
It wasn't long before my running shoes were back on, marking a new path for my journey, I learned that all of the miles, the tears, the sweat, and the pain my dad and I experienced together were not for a { wish ### duty ### rank ### race } .
Many years ago, whites ruled South Africa. Apartheid was the { property ### mistake ### law ### custom } of the land.
One of them had a permit to work in the area, the other did not, which { meant ### showed ### replied ### imagined } he could be put behind bars for staying in this zone.
 { Happily ### Suddenly ### Finally ### Generally } they saw a policeman coming towards them, and froze .
 Suddenly they saw a policeman coming towards them, and { hid ### fell ### cried ### froze } .
whispered the man with the permit to his friend, I'll { fight ### explain ### follow ### walk } They started running and the policeman began chasing them, shouting stop, stop .
he snarled. Show me your { invitation ### permit ### pocket ### ticket } !
The policeman was surprised and realized that he had been { fooled ### hurt ### blamed ### abandoned } .
When you had a permit why did you run! he shouted { nervously ### sadly ### carefully ### angrily } .
Doctor's { attitudes ### methods ### orders ### hopes } , said the man.
Oh, yes? Sneered the policeman. Then why was your friend { stopping ### missing ### staying ### running } ?
The policeman became { shy ### strict ### red ### serious } with anger.
You think you're very { brave ### healthy ### native ### smart } , don't you?
But tell me, if you were running { only ### also ### never ### often } for your health why didn't you stop when you saw me running after you?
I know you did! Of course I { remembered ### knew ### believed ### agreed } you were running after me, said the man.
It was { stupid ### rude ### kind ### wise } of me, said the man, but I thought you too had been ordered to run by your doctor.
Her daughter, Lora, wanted to { keep ### leave ### quit ### stop } her husband and move back home with her new baby.
For the first time Ruth Ann { wondered ### minded ### cared' ### considered } if she had the strength to keep Lora from getting her own way.
If Lora wanted something I would be { sure ### necessary ### likely ### possible } that she got it, she recalled.
Lora's father had left the { work ### task ### job ### family } when Lora was 15.
When Lora was 20 years old, she { met ### recognized ### knew ### married } Scott Mesker, and the early years of their married life were plainful and exhausting.
 { With ### For ### As ### In } the birth of their son.
Scott and Lora became { workers ### students ### parents ### strangers } in the same household.
 { If ### When ### While ### Although } she had been a Christian since childhood, some of her best friends advised, God will forgive you if you get a divorce .
 Although she had been a Christian since childhood, some of her best friends advised, { Mother ### God ### Husband ### Child } will forgive you if you get a divorce .
Lora knew that her mom { should ### will ### would ### need } let her come home with the baby.
Ruth Ann knew Lora's marriage was in { danger ### time ### trouble ### state } , and had discussed the situation with Wayne and he would that Ruth Ann should not come to Lora's rescue .
Ruth Ann knew Lora's marriage was in God , and had discussed the situation with Wayne and he { announced ### declared ### decided ### advised } that Ruth Ann should not come to Lora's rescue .
Ruth Ann had not always { seen ### listened ### pointed ### referred } to Wayne when Lora was a teenager, but she would now.
She could not { think ### meet ### imagine ### receive } Lora taking her young son through the state of divorce .
She could not would Lora taking her young son through the { feeling ### excitement ### pain ### pleasure } of divorce .
As she talked with Lora on the phone, she sensed that God was telling her not to { want ### expect ### agree ### approve } to Lora's request to move home.
So she reluctantly said, I just can't { ask ### let ### make ### force } you come home.
You have to take a stand and make this work! Lora was in { comfort ### horror ### surprise ### disbelief } .
What she didn't see was Ruth Ann's body { crying ### shaking ### standing ### falling } from uncontrollable weeping.
A daughter complained to her father about her life and { how ### what ### although ### unless } things have been so hard for her.
It seemed that just as { the ### a ### one ### this } one problem was solved another arose .
It seemed that just as one one problem was solved another { raised ### arose ### aroused ### rose } .
Her father, a cook, took her to the kitchen , filled three pots with water and { placed ### brought ### threw ### took } them on the fire.
Soon the three pots came to a { end ### boil ### break ### burn } .
He placed carrots, eggs, and coffee beans into them { slowly ### quickly ### hurriedly ### separately } .
He let them boil, without { speaking ### writing ### saying ### showing } a word.
In half a(n) { day ### hour ### minute ### second } he walked over to the stove and turned off the fire.
He pulled out the carrots and the eggs, ladled out the { soup ### water ### coffee ### juice } and put them in three different bowls.
He brought her closer and asked her to { eat ### smell ### feel ### taste } the carrots.
They were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and { drop ### fall ### bite ### break } it.
 { finally ### gradually ### naturally ### carefully } , he asked her to sip the coffee.
She { screamed ### cried ### smiled ### laughed } , as she tasted its rich aroma .
he explained, However, each { answered ### exchanged ### treated ### reacted } differently.
The carrot was strong and hard, but soon became { weak ### hot ### warm ### delicious } .
The egg was fragile with a { thick ### hard ### white ### thin } shell and a liquid center.
They had changed the water. { how ### which ### who ### what } are you?
 { Since ### Until ### If ### After } he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin .
 After he handed them all out, he asked his students to { fold ### turn ### open ### use } the page and begin .
To everyone's surprise, there were no { exercises ### choices ### questions ### scores } , just a black dot in the center of the page.
The professor, seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following: I want you to write what you { remember ### imagine ### study ### see } there.
The students, { surprised ### confused ### curious ### displeased } , got started on the inexplicable task.
At the end of the class, the professor { collected ### finished ### marked ### selected } all the answer papers and started reading each of them aloud in front of all the students.
All of them, with no { excuse ### doubt ### exception ### explanation } , described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc.
After all had been { said ### answered ### returned ### read } , the classroom was silent, and the professor began to explain: I'm not going to grade this.
I { also ### just ### even ### finally } wanted to give you something to think about.
No one wrote about the { big ### black ### beautiful ### white } part of the paper.
Everyone focused on the black dot, and the same happens in our { lives ### classrooms ### colleagues ### studies } .
We have a white paper to observe and { send ### keep ### enjoy ### show } , but we always focus on the dark spots.
Our life is a { burden ### gift ### pressure ### lesson } given to us with love and care, and we always have enjoy to celebrate : nature renewing itself every day, our friends around us, the job that gift our livelihood and the miracle we see every day .

 lives , we insist on focusing only on the dark spots : the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the enjoy relationship with colleagues, the { stay ### contact ### satisfaction ### disappointment } with a friend, and etc .
The dark spots are very { dark ### round ### small ### dirty } compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds.
The professor was very { peaceful ### accustomed ### nervous ### absent } in class.
He just looked at his lecture notes and { frequently ### suddenly ### nearly ### rarely } looked up at us.
I felt that I needed to get rid of my boredom, so I created a little { game ### prize ### toy ### advantage } for myself.
I tried to find something from his lecture to ask a question about, forcing me to { stare ### concentrate ### comment ### present } rather than letting my eyes close.
I continued to do this every day in the course and found my-self ac tually { improving ### writing ### misunderstanding ### enjoying } the material.
The professor became a bit more { relaxed ### graceful ### serious ### clever } and some other students also joined me in asking questions.
My little game had { separated ### saved ### awoken ### avoided } me from being bored, as it was expected to do .
My little game had saved me from being bored, { which ### since ### as ### what } it was expected to do .
The professor obviously knew his material, but had a hard time { carrying ### passing ### bringing ### putting } it on to his undergraduates in an interesting way.
Each of us can have a(n) { idea ### effect ### effort ### power } not just on our own experiences, but on those of others, and I'll never forget the professor who taught me a lesson about the power of acts of kindness, intended passing not .

The tile floors were always { warm ### empty ### tidy ### cold } and the rainy winter days there seemed endless.

I families to wash my clothes by hand in the bathtub and cold water was so costly, I trained myself to { wash ### comb ### arrange ### adopt } my waist-length hair in less than five minutes .
At that time there were no cell phones and the Internet didn't exist so far six months I had no { contact ### quarrel ### letter ### chance } at all with my family or friends in the US.
I had no relatives there so I { turned ### needed ### pretended ### stopped } to face the fact that my learned to adapt and create a life for since ,was one hundred percent up to me .

At age seventeen my need for friends was { impossible ### hopeless ### beneficial ### strong } and not knowing a soul was, needless to say, a bit stressful.
To { adapt ### apply ### add ### reduce } to my stress, I didn't speak the since and had no familiarity with the monetary system nor the transportation system .
To learned to my stress, I didn't speak the { truth ### language ### fact ### word } and had no familiarity with the monetary system nor the transportation system .
One more { scene ### shortage ### fault ### challenge } that created stress was my since family .
One more learned that created stress was my { own ### former ### host ### guest } family .
Of all the families in the city I lived, I was { occupied ### housed ### compared ### chosen } with the ones who spoke the least (or worst) English.
Living abroad and developing { fluency ### trouble ### habit ### fame } in a foreign language required persistence and determination.
I made many mistakes { over ### along ### in ### during } the way.
Now I've transformed my { harmful ### beautiful ### hopeful ### stressful } memories into my medals of honor .
They're the treasured stories that offer wisdom, provide me with insights into friends and family and provide me with the { advantage ### confidence ### promise ### future } that I can surpass future challenges.
At the age of 13,I visited a doctor with my parents.As I sat in the examining chair,the doctor looked into my 36 { mouth ### eyes ### ears ### throat } .
You need to be prepared.There is no 37 { solution ### reason ### excuse ### cure } for this disease.
My father 38 { carried ### spread ### infected ### raised } a gene which,in most cases,results in blindness .
I'd inherited the gene . He gradually 39 { damaged ### lost ### recovered ### gained } his eyesight and so did I .
At last we were both 40 { rapidly ### nearly ### completely ### terribly } blind--he was fiftyseven years old,41 but I was only twentyeight .
At last we were both 40 completely blind--he was fiftyseven years old,41 { though ### but ### so ### since } I was only twentyeight .
My world 42 broke down as the darkness fell,43 { realizing ### sharing ### disturbing ### destroying } the dreams my husband and I had for us and for our three little boys .
But 44 { when ### before ### unless ### until } I tried to find some hope and 45 destroying ,my eyes were opened to a new realization .
But 44 but I tried to find some hope and 45 { honour ### beauty ### strength ### failure } ,my eyes were opened to a new realization .

My father had 46 but me not just failing eyesight,but an example of 47 { contribution ### determination ### challenge ### honesty } in the face of hardships as well .
We were all living in Bolivia in 1964 when he decided to 48 { move ### settle ### arrange ### send } the family to America .
He worked tirelessly to 49 { enjoy ### declare ### apply ### win } the right of living in the US .
Alone in the States,he 50 { accepted ### admitted ### overcame ### met } his helplessness and lack of fluency in English.He managed to rent a small apartment,and nine months later,sent airline tickets for my mom,my brother and me.
Decades later,51 { as ### like ### for ### to } an American citizen,I look back at what he'd shown me .
His 52 { knowledge ### journey ### situation ### event } taught me valuable lessons for my own path in the darkness .
I did the same as I stepped into a 53 { cruel ### inner ### modern ### dark } world .
I fulfilled my own 54 { promises ### hopes ### roles ### changes } as a wife,mom,Sunday school teacher and Spanish interpreter .
What I inherited from my father helped me to { touch ### end ### save ### see } my life in a whole new light .
I threw the paper away and rushed to the scene . Mydaughter Sindu looked { excited ### frightened ### moved ### disappointed } .
In front of her was a bowl { provided ### covered ### filled ### equipped } with bitter melon .
Sindu particularly hated bitter melon, but my wife believed 3 { firmly ### angrily ### heavily ### happily } in the cooling effects of bitter melon .
I tried to { permit ### forbid ### persuade ### order } Sindu to take a fewmouthfuls .
She { went ### calmed ### came ### fought } down a bit and wiped her tears .
Then she said she would eat the { sweet ### entire ### bitter ### little } bowl of bitter melon on condition that I gave her whatever she asked for .
I agreed . Slowly and { angrily ### worriedly ### painfully ### sadly } , she finished the whole bowl .
After that, Sindu came to me with her eyeswide with { expectation ### happiness ### satisfaction ### pride } .
To our surprise, she wanted to have her head { nodded ### cut ### washed ### shaved } .
shouted my wife.However, I knew that if I went back on my promise, Sindu would neverlearn to { honor ### remind ### share ### take } her own.So I decided to keep my promise.
On Monday morning, I { dropped ### sent ### took ### picked } her off at school.Just then,a boy shouted, Sindu,wait for me!
What struck me was { its ### her ### his ### my } hairless head .
I was about to leave when a ladycame to me and said, Sir, your { wife ### daughter ### view ### life } is great indeed !
I didn't { insist ### request ### move ### understand } .
She continued, That boy is my son . He is { dying ### escaping ### suffering ### recovering } from Leukemia .
He lost all his hair because of the side effects of the chemotherapy * He { tended ### promised ### refused ### determined } to come back to school because hewas afraid that the kids at school would make fun of him .
Sindu visited him last week andpromised to help him, but I { nearly ### never ### ever ### seldom } imagined that she would sacrifice her lovely hair for thesake of my son !
Sir, you and your wife are blessed to have such a(n) { abstract ### simple ### noble ### horrible } soul for achild.
Worse still, Dad { took ### minded ### missed ### picked } a step and fell, sending my new suitcases rooling down the stairs .
Worse still, Dad missed a step and fell, sending my new suitcases { rooling ### passing ### dropping ### turning } down the stairs .
he screamed, his face turning red. I knew { suffering ### difficulty ### troubled ### danger } was ahead.
How could I ever { lead ### help ### encourage ### get } him to finish unloading the car troubled screaming at me and making a scene in front of the other girls, girls I would have to spend the get of the year with ?

I felt it in my bones that my college life was getting off to a(n) { fresh ### late ### bad ### unfair } start.
 { Search ### Find ### enter ### Book } the room quickly, I thought.
Or would it be a(n) { small ### empty ### new ### neat } room?
Finally I turned the key in the lock and pushed the door open, with Dad { yet ### only ### even ### still } complaining about a hurting knee or something.
I put my head in, expecting the { worst ### chair ### best ### tea } .
But to my { regret ### disappointment ### surprise ### knowledge } , the room wasn't empty at all!
And there on a well-made bed sat Amy, my new { roommate ### classmate ### neighbour ### companion } , dressed neatly.
And of course, you're Mr. Faber, she said, { questioning ### wondering ### smiling ### guessing } .
I knew then that Amy and I would be { sisters ### friends ### students ### fellows } and my first year of college would be a success.
A certain good woman one day said something that hurt her best friend of many years.She { said ### felt ### regretted ### explained } immediately and would have done anything to have taken the words back.
 { That ### Which ### Who ### What } she said hurt the friend so much that this good woman was herself hurt for the pain she caused .
 What she said hurt the friend so much that this good woman was herself hurt { for ### as ### to ### of } the pain she caused .
In an effort to cancel what she had done,she went to an older,wiser woman in the village,explained her situation,and asked for { question ### suggestion ### advice ### practice } .
Listening to her,the older woman { sensed ### touched ### smelt ### breathed } the younger woman's distress and knew she must help her .
She also knew she could never { raise ### release ### relieve ### rehearse } her pain,but she could teach .
She knew the { outline ### outcome ### output ### outbreak } would depend only on the character of the younger woman .
She said, Tonight,take your best feather pillows and put a single feather on the doorstep of each house in the town { until ### unless ### after ### before } the sun rises .
The young woman hurried { home ### south ### inside ### outdoors } to prepare for her chore,even though the feather pillows were very before to her .
The young woman hurried outbreak to prepare for her chore,even though the feather pillows were very { heavy ### brilliant ### colorful ### dear } to her .
Finally the sky was getting { light ### dark ### rainy ### sunny } ,she placed the last feather on the steps of the last house .
Now, said the wise woman, Go back and { recite ### rebuild ### refill ### recycle } your pillows with the feather you have put on the steps .
Then everything will be { with ### just ### like ### as } it was before .
You know that's { impossible ### important ### imaginable ### immoral } !
The wind blew away each feather as fast as I placed them on the { house ### doorsteps ### pillow ### bag } !
Never forget . Each of your { action ### feather ### words ### behavior } is like a feather in the wind .
Once spoken,no amount of effort, { friendless ### regardless ### homeless ### hopeless } how heartfelt or sincere,they can never return to your mouth .
Choose your words well and { guarantee ### secure ### maintain ### guard } them most of all in the presence of those you love .
Because he was only a seed, { everybody ### nobody ### someone ### anything } cared to notice him.
Then one day, a { wind ### bird ### boy ### man } picked him up and threw him on an open field under the sun.
He was { confused ### glad ### excited ### hurt } , thinking, Why would a wind do such a thing?
But instead of any pleasant answers, he was { made ### covered ### heated ### provided } with sunlight as well as rain , sometimes light and sometimes heavy .
But instead of any pleasant answers, he was provided with sunlight as well as { food ### rain ### friends ### flowers } , sometimes light and sometimes heavy .
Time flew by and years later, he saw a { traveler ### woman ### dog ### god } sitting by his side.
Thank God for this. I really need some { water ### 1ove ### rest ### money } ,he heard the traveler say.
Surely he had seen many people sitting by his side, { so ### because ### but ### since } no one ever spoke to him like that.
Who is this? The man was { angered ### delighted ### moved ### surprised } This is me, the seed.
The seed? The man looked at the big { stone ### mountain ### tree ### river } Are you kidding me?
A big tree ! { When ### Really ### Where ### Who } ?
Yes! Why else do you think people { hate ### leave ### live ### come } here?
What do they come here for? To { hunt ### like ### enjoy ### steal } your shade!
Don't tell me you didn't know you had { appeared ### survived ### grown ### risen } over time.
The seed, now a big tree, thought and { cried ### smiled ### sang ### danced } for the first time in his life.
Oh! That means I'm not a(n) { small ### beautiful ### ugly ### lovely } seed anymore!
Wow! I'm a big tree now. That's the { experience ### adventure ### reason ### life } that I really want !
Perhaps the most important one was the life-changing { method ### ability ### power ### approach } of encouraging words.
I { improved ### learned ### wondered ### used } what Leo Buscaglia had done with his students in University of Southern California.
In one class Leo Buscaglia and his students had made two lists of { books ### words ### ideas ### tasks } , one positive and one negative.
Then they { threw ### collected ### stored ### wrote } the negative words in the trash and tried to use only the positive words for one month .
Then they threw the negative words in the trash and tried to use only the { familiar ### standard ### common ### positive } words for one month .
They were { curious ### disappointed ### amazed ### confused } at how much better their lives became just by using words full of positive I decided to try this as well by amazed something good to write on each paper my students handed in .

No matter how many mistakes a student's paper threw , there was always a positive sentence, beautiful thought, or a great idea that I could { agree ### comment ### bring ### depend } on .
I remember glancing over my desk and { keeping ### having ### seeing ### 1eaving } some of the students reading those encouraging words again and again .
It was a joy seeing their eyes shine a little brighter, their { 1egs ### waists ### backs ### shoulders } sit up a little straighter, and their learning climb a lot amazed .
It was a joy seeing their eyes shine a little brighter, their positive sit up a little straighter, and their learning climb a lot { further ### higher ### deeper ### wider } .
I recently saw one of my { present ### clever ### careful ### former } students and we talked for a while.
As I was saying goodbye, he said, You know I { ever ### never ### still ### merely } have a few of those old papers.
I just { hope ### admit ### complain ### remember } my kids have a good teacher like you.
I was amazed at the { result ### strength ### effect ### importance } those few positive words had on his life.
I was actually asking myself why can't someone be kind enough to take me on as an { engineer ### entertainer ### employee ### employer } .
I said, These are a little big but they should keep { her ### him ### you ### me } warm.
I told her my being cold for 15 minutes { until ### before ### after ### since } I got to my place was worth it if I knew she would be a little warmer.
I just told her to pass it on . Then after I got on the bus that's { where ### why ### when ### how } the miracle of spreading kindness happened .
I just told her to pass it on . Then after I got on the bus that's when the miracle of spreading { luck ### kindness ### generosity ### mercy } happened .

I stepped up to pay the when and the bus driver said, Mam, I saw what you just did and your fare is { to ### for ### on ### with } me, even though technically we aren't supposed to let you get on the bus without shoes .
A lady who was dressed in a very { informal ### casual ### professional ### practical } business suit called me over to her seat.
She said, I want to know the { job ### address ### religion ### name } of the person who just did the most ticket thing I have ever seen .
She said, I want to know the kindness of the person who just did the most { inspiring ### courageous ### amazing ### grateful } thing I have ever seen .
I told her my name and she said , What can I do for you to { praise ### repay ### appreciate ### admire } what I just witnessed?
I { seriously ### eagerly ### hopefully ### jokingly } said a paying job would be nice.
The next day she called me and said that she had a { part-time ### tough ### simple ### novel } administrative assistant position professional in her company and wanted me to meet with the manager .

In a hurry to dive into the { deep ### clean ### cool ### dirty } water, he ran out the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks, and shirt as he went.
He flew into the water, not { seeing ### realizing ### hearing ### finding } that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was swimming toward the shore .
He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was swimming toward the { shore ### middle ### lake ### water } .
In utter fear, she ran toward the water, crying to her son as { angrily ### loudly ### clearly ### happily } as she could.
Hearing her voice, the little boy became alarmed and swam { back ### forward ### out ### in } to his mother.
It was too late. Just as he { arrived ### touched ### reached ### pulled } her, the alligatorsnatched him.
The alligator was much { bigger ### stronger ### younger ### smaller } than the mother, but the mother tried her best not to let go.
A farmer happened to { walk ### run ### pass ### drive } by, heard her screams, raced from his truck and shot the alligator.
Fortunately, after weeks in the hospital, the little boy { survived ### killed ### injured ### saved } .
His legs were extremely scarred by the { fight ### struggle ### attempt ### attack } of the animal and, on his arms, were deep scratches survived his mother's fingernails dug into his flesh in her attack to save the son she loved .

The boy lifted his { arms ### hands ### legs ### fingers } .
And then, with obvious { sadness ### worries ### surprise ### pride } , he said to the reporter.
We have scars, too, not from an alligator, or { nobody ### somebody ### anything ### everything } quite so dramatic , where the scars of a painful past .
We have scars, too, not from an alligator, or attack quite so dramatic , { but ### because ### if ### unless } the scars of a painful past .
But, some { memories ### wounds ### feelings ### hurt } are because love has refused to let go.
In the midst of your struggle, she's been there { keeping ### pushing ### waiting ### holding } on to you.
I'd like to { argue ### discuss ### share ### compare } with you one of my favorites.
He was very { happy ### upset ### friendly ### frightened } because he couldn't keep his friends.
His father { just ### hardly ### also ### once } replied, Son, each time you say or do something that hurts one of your friends, hammer a piece of wood into the ground .
His father just replied, Son, each time you say or do something that { leaves ### pleases ### hurts ### amuses } one of your friends, hammer a piece of wood into the ground .
His father just replied, Son, each time you say or do something that hurts one of your friends, hammer a piece of wood into the { wall ### ground ### field ### door } .
Well, Son, each time you say something { surprising ### interesting ### nice ### bad } to a friend, you can take one piece of wood out.
The boy { did ### made ### refused ### said } this, too.
On the third day he took out some more. Finally he had { removed ### repeated ### replanted ### recycled } all of the wood.
But Father! he cried again, Look at the { sand ### dirt ### holes ### sticks } in the ground!
Son, his father said, this is why you aren't able to { make ### meet ### keep ### stay } your friends.
Remember : when you hurt someone's feeling, no matter what you do to { turn ### take ### bring ### make } up for it, there will always be a scar in his holes .
Remember : when you hurt someone's feeling, no matter what you do to removed up for it, there will always be a scar in his { heart ### face ### neck ### hand } .
From that day on, the boy was very { afraid ### careful ### proud ### fond } of his words and actions and he never hurt his friends' feelings again.
I always keep this story close to my heart. It has { found ### taught ### lent ### saved } me lot.
I am always careful not to hurt any of my friends because they are people that I wouldn't want to { avoid ### admire ### respect ### lose } .
We didn't argue,but we hardly { exchanged ### spoke ### touched ### communicated } .
I knew that one { result ### problem ### idea ### method } was that I often scold him.
Unfortunately, I looked only at his faults and forgot to notice how { well ### badly ### Angrily ### really } he had done in everything.
Why did he leave his books everywhere in his study instead of putting them in order ?How could he wear that { clean ### dirty ### smart ### tidy } shirt again?
The next day ,I told Val I was glad he was patient with my faults and said { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } about the way I often scold him.
He smiled a small, weak smile that made me { happy ### excited ### frightened ### angry } , Maybe this isn't going to work.
But as three weeks continued, finding something good about my husband came more easily .He deals honestly with everyone; he treats our children with { kindness ### pride ### rudeness ### fear } .Why had I seen so many unpleasant things?
By the end of the 21 days, I couldn't believe how easy { this ### that ### it ### I } had become to praise Val.

He { suddenly ### occasionally ### immediately ### casually } thought the yacht had hit a rock.
But when he looked up, he saw the whale { drifting ### jumping ### falling ### sliding } down the deck of the boat.
It was a very { surprising ### annoying ### frightening ### astonishing } moment.

The whale had ruined the mast and rigging--the pole and ropes which hold the { boat ### beach ### sail ### journey } --and so the family was left with no way at sea, 10 miles from the shore.
The { radio ### craft ### guide ### compass } equipment was also damaged, but fortunately they had a cell phone and were able to call for help.

When I read something that I really want to { connect ### remember ### recognize ### know } , I often have an audio recording play along with it.
It can help my memory absorb what I'm { listening ### speaking ### reading ### writing } .
I always find that my listening abilities improve { when ### unless ### until ### though } I have a visual reference at the beginning.
When I'm { excited ### willing ### relieved ### able } to take away one or the other after the initial go-through, I find that I can actually remember the learning materials better .
When I'm able to take away one or the other after the initial go-through, I { find ### believe ### hope ### admit } that I can actually remember the learning materials better .
So that mixing of the visual and the audial { forces ### allows ### requires ### encourages } me to memorize things right away.
Another { explanation ### discussion ### way ### plan } I can mix this audial with the visual is by reading the material out allows .

As I've said before, my hearing can often be { controlled ### assisted ### damaged ### examined } by my literacy and vision.
Reading to myself aloud helps me { communicate ### improve ### analyze ### learn } because, like having an audio recording, it improves my reading and listening.
I always { develop ### prepare ### share ### enjoy } these because my teacher and classmates all contribute to my loudly learning style of mixing listening with visual acuteness .
I always way these because my teacher and classmates all contribute to my { preferred ### expected ### important ### practical } learning style of mixing listening with visual acuteness .

I've also seen many of my classmates following my loudly and asking for materials with audio recordings to assist in their reading and { imagination ### progress ### memorization ### challenge } .

A particular picture { exactly ### especially ### properly ### only } touched me.

I taped the picture to our refrigerator, explaining their { illness ### anger ### question ### difficulty } to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three-year-old Meghan.
We have so much, and these { strange ### ordinary ### poor ### wild } people now have nothing, I said.

Of course, guests it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves,that is the { resource ### source ### result ### point } of your problems and stress .
It is sure that the cup itself { increases ### expands ### extends ### adds } no quality to the coffee.

What all of you really want is coffee,not the cup,but you went { happily ### strangely ### consciously ### surprisingly } for the best cups .

You can pick grapes on farms in France, entertain kids on American summer camps, and, of course, there are { always ### hardly ### never ### seldsom } jobs in hotels and restaurants.
 { If ### Unless ### Because ### Although } you speak the language of the country well, there will be very few openings, says Althea Ellis, an adviser in vacation work for students.
When you wash dishes in a restaurant in Pairs, the owner will expect you to speak { Italian ### English ### French ### Spanish } .
British students only have a language { chance ### ability ### possibility ### advantage } for jobs in the USA and Australia.
The two teachers with the children had never been { abroad ### employed ### sad ### respected } .

One child lost his passport ; another became seriously ill and was French home ; the whole group was thrown out of one hotel because of the advantage they made, and what's worse, Sarah herself was robbed on her only { busy ### free ### tiring ### pleasant } evening of the entire trip .
The pay was { nice ### reasonable ### fair ### poor } and it really was a 24-hour-a-day job.
The troubles is, students expect to have a(n) { hard ### easy ### difficult ### ordinary } time of it.
Althea Ellis points out. After all, they see it as a { holiday ### job ### festival ### study } .
In practice, { besides ### therefore ### however ### meanwhile } ,you have to work hard .
In the other words, you'll work if it's convenient for the company that { fires ### employs ### recommends ### appreciants } you.
But you have { few ### little ### all ### much } employment rights.
As soon as the holiday season { starts ### lasts ### approaches ### finishes } ,they'll get rid of you.
At 12 inches long and { showing ### counting ### measuring ### weighing } only one pound and nine ounces, she was a premature baby.
But the doctor's soft words dropped like { gifts ### bombs ### orders ### comforts } .

There's only a 10-percent chance she will pull through the night, and even then, if by some chance she does make it, her future could be a very { easy ### common ### cruel ### peaceful } one .

David and Diana listened as the doctor chance the serious problems the newly--born baby, Anna, would { bravely ### likely ### completely ### firmly } face if she survived .
She would never walk; she would never { talk ### taste ### breathe ### see } ; she would probably be blind; and so on.
No! No! was all Diana could { act ### consider ### say ### refuse } .
She and David, with their 5-year-old son Dusfin, had long dreamed of the day they would have a daughter to become a { family ### group ### team ### unit } of four.
Certainly, there was 51 never a moment when Anna suddenly grew { happier ### stronger ### quieter ### calmer } .
But as the weeks went by, she did { strangely ### sharply ### particularly ### slowly } gain an ounce of weight here and an ounce of say there .
But as the weeks went by, she did talk gain an ounce of weight here and an ounce of { strength ### progress ### skill ### wisdom } there .
At last, when Anna turned two months old, her parents were able to { hold ### grasp ### touch ### defend } her in their arms for the very first time though say continued to gently but coldly family that her chances of surviving, much less living any kind of normal life, were next to zero .

At last, when Anna turned two months old, her parents were able to talk her in their arms for the very first time though say continued to gently but coldly { notice ### warn ### judge ### urge } that her chances of surviving, much less living any kind of normal life, were next to zero .
Finally, Anna went home from the hospital, just as her mother had { doubted ### feared ### hoped ### accused } .
She shows no { effects ### marks ### signs ### evidences } of any mental or physical injuries.
But he had always { waited ### failed ### finished ### rested } .
Finally, when the clouds gathered around him, he understood he wouldn't be able to { reach ### find ### miss ### measure } the top that day.
One day, he went up the mountain { attracted ### protected ### controlled ### accompanied } by old Peeper, the town optician .
Halfway to the top, Peeper gave him a pair of { special ### beautiful ### big ### expensive } sunglasses.
They'll { save ### help ### follow ### test } you, said Peeper before he went back.
Bobby accepted the { material ### pity ### design ### gift } .
Just as nearly always seemed to happen, bad luck { stood ### changed ### returned ### disappeared } in the form of cloud cover.
Bobby remembered Peeper's { plans ### words ### thoughts ### points } and put on the glasses.
He could { still ### never ### only ### ever } see the clouds with the glasses on, but they seemed so light that he could see the top of the mountain through the clouds .
He could still see the clouds with the glasses on, but they seemed so light that he could see the top of the mountain { beside ### under ### before ### through } the clouds .
And so Bobby kept climbing, leaving the clouds behind, and { personally ### finally ### necessarily ### nearly } arrived at the top of the mountain.
But as he took off the glasses, he was { frightened ### angry ### surprised ### disappointed } -- the mountain below was surrounded by a sea of clouds.
Bobby didn't remember the clouds being as { thick ### pretty ### white ### small } as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and surprised everything .
Bobby didn't remember the clouds being as finally as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and { proved ### explained ### remembered ### understood } everything .
Peeper had made a light picture on the glasses, in the { middle ### form ### way ### place } of the snow-covered mountain top.
It was made in such a way that Bobby could only { feel ### copy ### see ### touch } it if he looked upwards.
Bobby { realized ### agreed ### imagined ### told } that the only obstacle to getting to the top of the mountain had been his own discouragement.
He thanked Peeper for using that little { experiment ### chance ### shock ### trick } to help him understand that his aim was not impossible.
His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria, but it was { happy ### hard ### easy ### nice } for Dave to find work, and the price of everything was rising.
The Fusses were at the risk of joining the millions of Americans who have { lost ### bought ### left ### wanted } their homes in recent years.
Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely { gift ### money ### encouragement ### package } --$7,000, a legacy from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident.
But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to { accept ### defeat ### win ### receive } unexpected legacy from the Hatches.
Dozens of other families were { amazed ### excited ### upset ### touched } by what the Hatches had done.
It { surprised ### frightened ### pleased ### encouraged } nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm.
Children of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of { kind ### generous ### living ### saving } .
Through the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camps when their parents couldn't { afford ### buy ### offer ### keep } it.
Ish and Arlene never asked if you { suffered ### enjoyed ### needed ### did } anything, says their friend Sandy Van Weelden, They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.
It was the Hatches' wish that their legacy--a legacy of kindness as much as one of dollars and cents--should { enrich ### bless ### brighten ### expand } the whole community and last for generations to come.
They had { earned ### borrowed ### spent ### wasted } all their money, and life was hard for them.
The doctors were { criticized ### touched ### fascinated ### attracted } by the brother and the sister's close relationship and experiences, so the hospital decided to have a kidney transplantation operation for the girl, completely free of charge.
Naturally her brother would { buy ### lend ### donate ### find } one of his kidneys.
Everything went well and the { payment ### discussion ### operation ### recovery } time was fixed.
 { Immediately ### Slowly ### Carefully ### Comfortably } smile froze on his face.
The doctor { talked ### explained ### said ### joked } to him that if his kidney was transplanted successfully, his sister would be saved ; otherwise, she would die .
The doctor explained to him that if his kidney was transplanted successfully, his sister would be { saved ### killed ### protected ### moved } ; otherwise, she would die .
The mute brother { cried ### suspected ### hesitated ### doubted } for one minute and nodded to the doctor seriously.
 { And ### Or ### So ### But } to everyone's surprise, the brother disappeared that afternoon.
The doctor asked Xiaoxiao what her brother told her before { coming ### escaping ### arriving ### leaving } .
That made the doctors { delighted ### worried ### angry ### calm } a lot.
Then, Xiaoxiao burst into { tears ### cheers ### laughter ### shynessK } .
She told doctors that her brother had gone back to plant corns in { his ### her ### their ### our } fields and prepared firewood for her.
When his morning lessons were over, he was allowed to { amuse ### think ### treat ### study } himself for one hour as he pleased.
There was a river nearby. On its bank { built ### set ### stood ### had } the hut of a poor fisherman.
He could not teach his only son, Joe, himself, { so ### but ### or ### and } he was too poor to send him to school.
Charles happened to { visit ### call ### pass ### approach } at the hut one day.
He found Joe was making { houses ### discoveries ### marks ### designs } with a piece of chalk.
If I could { even ### hardly ### again ### only } learn to read and write, said he, I should be the happiest boy in the world .
If I could only learn to read and write, said he, I should be the { happiest ### cleverest ### strongest ### luckiest } boy in the world .
Then I will make you happy, said Charles. I can { manage ### acquire ### teach ### help } you that.
Both Joe and his father were ready to fall on their { eyes ### knees ### hands ### heads } to thank Charles.
They told him it was what they wished { above ### of ### with ### for } all things.
So, on the next day when the { hour ### order ### telephone ### message } came, Charles went to teach Joe.
Some time after, a { friend ### neighbor ### policeman ### teacher } told Mr. Rose that his son often went to the house of the fisherman.
I { suggest ### expect ### fear ### promise } he goes out in their boat, said the gentleman.
The { hurry ### remark ### day ### moment } the neighbor left, Mr. Rose went in search of his son.
He went along the river, in hope of seeing the { boy ### fisherman ### boat ### hut } .
 { Unwilling ### Ready ### Anxious ### Uncertain } to leave without learning something of him, he went to the hut.
There a pleasant sight { avoided ### met ### flashed ### reflected } his eyes.
Charles was a little { satisfied ### confused ### excited ### interested } .
He feared his father might not be pleased, but he had no need to be uneasy, for his father was { annoyed ### determined ### puzzled ### delighted } .
Then Charles ran to Joe, his hands { closed ### held ### filled ### kept } with parcels, and his heart beating with joy.
She has { asked ### battled ### raised ### checked } more health problems through the years than anyone should have to tolerate.
Now as she approaches her 57th birthday she knows that it will { probably ### temporarily ### unbelievably ### hardly } be her last.
She has started { collecting ### purchasing ### consuming ### donating } a lot of her things.
She has given us her shining spirit that has made all of our lives so much { tougher ### stranger ### brighter ### heavier } .
When a local dog was { nearly ### accidentally ### suddenly ### cruelly } killed by a bear, my friend welcomed it into her home and nursed it back to health .
When a local dog was nearly killed by a bear, my friend welcomed it into her home and nursed it back to { death ### health ### happiness ### heaven } .
When any of us needed anything she was there doing all that she could with a { story ### purpose ### heart ### friend } full of love and a soul full of goodness.
She did all of this too while her health { refused ### stopped ### intended ### continued } to grow worse and worse.
My friend, { however ### therefore ### instead ### also } , is not afraid of death.
She has told me several times that she believes it will only be like a brief { report ### sleep ### journey ### account } and then she will awaken in Paradise.
I am { sure ### doubtful ### afraid ### pleased } as well that she will fit right in there because she already has a lot of paradise within herself.

He was severely disabled and very short ,and when we would walk together,his hand on my arm for { balance ### strength ### comfort ### courage } ,people would stare .
I would inwardly feel uncomfortable at the unwanted { care ### attention ### situation ### friendship } .
If he ever noticed or was bothered,he never { hoped ### found ### liked ### showed } that he knew .
It was { easy ### difficult ### possible ### necessary } to coordinate our steps--his hesitant,mine impatient--and because of that,we didn't showed much as we went along .
It was attention to coordinate our steps--his hesitant,mine impatient--and because of that,we didn't { see ### pay ### say ### give } much as we went along .
But as we started out,he always said, You set the { rule ### time ### step ### pace } .I will try to follow you.
Our usual walk was to or from the subway,which was { how ### why ### when ### where } he got to work.
He almost never missed a day,and would { get ### make ### take ### walk } it to the office even if others could not.
A matter of { sorrow ### thought ### energy ### pride } .
He never talked about himself as an object of pity,nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or { helpful ### interesting ### successful ### encouraging } .
What he looked for { on ### in ### at ### with } others was a good heart ,and if he found one,the make was good enough for him .
What he looked for how others was a good heart ,and if he found one,the { owner ### another ### winner ### other } was good enough for him .

 { And ### But ### Now ### Then } I know the times I don't have one myself.
He has been gone many years now,but I think of him often. I wonder if he { sensed ### smelled ### agreed ### hoped } I was unwilling to be seen with him during our pride .
He has been gone many years now,but I think of him often. I wonder if he make I was unwilling to be seen with him during our { walks ### talks ### stays ### visits } .
Now that I am older,I'm sorry that I never told him how sorry I was for my feeling { afraid ### proud ### ashamed ### disappointed } to be with him in public and how unworthy I felt to be his daughter .
At such times I put my hand on his arm to { find ### remain ### refill ### regain } my balance,and say, You set the pace.
As we were { walking ### setting ### checking ### selecting } out, the cashier praised me for my necklace .
I thanked her, and she asked { where ### why ### how ### when } .
I had gotten it at the department store just down the street, and told her that it was on sale for 40% { up ### out ### down ### off } .
My friend suggested that she should walk over and purchase one during her { work ### shopping ### break ### lunch } .
But the cashier said she couldn't { afford ### own ### get ### provide } it right now .
As we left the grocery store, I told my friend I { pretended ### happened ### attempted ### decided } to buy one for her.
She agreed, and offered to { buy ### pay ### discount ### borrow } for half.
So we went back to the department store and picked out a { beautiful ### cheap ### expensive ### matching } necklace for the cashier.
As we paid for it, the sales lady noticed that I was { purchasing ### carrying ### wearing ### copying } the same one.
You { must ### may ### can ### should } really like this necklace, she commented.
We told her { what ### which ### that ### who } we were buying it for.
She is a very sweet lady, she remarked, But she is going througha { long ### rough ### small ### broken } patch right now and has to drive a long way to work.
With gas { price ### pollution ### amount ### interest } so high it sure isn't easy.
With { disappointment ### patience ### excitement ### hesitation } ,we took the gift back to the grocery store and stood in line at the same cash register .

When our time came we just handed her the gift. She knew excitement what we had done and was so { enthusiastic ### thankful ### awkward ### ashamed } .
It feels so good to do nice things for { oneself ### ones ### others ### either } .
I grew up poor, with a { poor ### happy ### positive ### single } mother and two sisters and I never dreamed as a little girl that I would be able to help others .
I { laughed ### sighed ### amazed ### shouted } picking them up.
42 { Days ### Years ### Moments ### Weeks } later I found more pieces.

They really did look like beautiful butterflies. That day Paul 57 { reminded ### forced ### intended ### permitted } me to look up at prayer instead of down at garbage .
They really did look like beautiful butterflies. That day Paul 57 puts me to look up at { mistakes ### weaknesses ### beauty ### scenery } instead of down at garbage .

Most Chinese { congratulate ### spend ### celebrate ### take } the Spring Festival not only because they want to follow tradition,there are also some practical reasons to explain Chinese people's fever for the holiday .

At home ,one can { take ### spend ### waste ### kill } one's time to do whatever he or she wants,and one can spend money whenever one likes .

But there were always some obstacles along the way, an ordeal to get through , some work to be finished, some time to be given, a bill to be { paid ### got ### asked ### printed } .Then life would start.
It finally dawned on me that those { achievements ### obstacles ### duties ### opinions } were part of life.
Little by little, that point of { view ### life ### position ### condition } also helped me see that there isn't any road to happiness.
So, enjoy every moment. And bear in mind that { happiness ### time ### age ### road } waits for no one.
So stop waiting for school to end, for a return to school, to lose ten pounds, to { gain ### reduce ### weigh ### enjoy } ten pounds, for work to begin, to get married,...before deciding to be happy.
There is no { worse ### better ### more ### less } time to be happy than...NOW!

I learned how to { mix ### draw ### find ### talk } colors today!
And Michelle { cooked ### played ### stayed ### painted } with us.She said she likes the way the paint feels through her fingers.
Something about my child's excitement caught my { sight ### attention ### interest ### observation } , and I realized that I had never finger-painted with Kayla.
As a result, my child had learned about { color ### art ### finger ### fun } from a blind friend.

But Mommy, Michelle understand exactly what was in my { attitude ### picture ### world ### life } !

One day, Mrs. Nanette O'Neill gave an arithmetic { paper ### problem ### test ### lesson } to our class.
When the papers were marked she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the { easy ### funny ### same ### serious } mistakes throughout the test.
There is nothing really new about43 { lying ### cheating ### guessing ### discussing } in exams.
Perhaps that was why Mrs. O'Neill { didn't ### did ### would ### wouldn't } even say a word about it.
She only asked the twelve boys to { come ### leave ### apologize ### remain } after class.
I was one of the twelve. Mrs . O'Neill asked { no ### certain ### many ### more } questions, and she didn't help us either .
I was one of the twelve. Mrs . O'Neill asked no questions, and she didn't { excuse ### reject ### help ### scold } us either .

She then ordered us to { repeat ### copy ### put ### get } these words into our exercise-books one hundred times.

Speaking for repeat I can say : it was the most important single { chance ### incident ### lesson ### memory } of my life .

Even now as I look through the boxes of Christmas decorations I can see the familiar ones: the presents with our birth years on them, our five stockings, four for the { kids ### girls ### boys ### babies } , one for the dog.
It used to be easy for us to { wonder ### get ### record ### decide } when to put up the decorations.
But now since we all have { toys ### balls ### jobs ### candies } and social lives, it is usually a hurried activity.
As we get older, the season almost brings a { surprise ### pain ### joy ### disappointment } to a little place in our hearts.
The worst was year after my grandparents had { died ### failed ### succeeded ### married } .

When he was walking around a pond, a strange idea { fixed ### focused ### came ### looked } upon him and he asked, How many buckets of water are there in the pond?
The ministers looked at each other, { struggling ### thinking ### falling ### failing } to give an answer.
Rather { disappointed ### excited ### pleased ### contented } , the king ordered, You have three days' grace.
Those who fail will be { killed ### punished ### blamed ### scolded } .
The king told his { exciting ### amazing ### surprising ### trembling } ministers to go with the child for the measurement.
To their { doubt ### surprise ### envy ### delight } , the child refused the suggestion with a smile, It is very easy.
No { good ### use ### need ### wonder } to go to the pond.
This made the king laugh { wonderfully ### joyfully ### cheerfully ### doubtfully } , Alright, let us know what it is.
The child winked and said, That { decides ### depends ### calls ### looks } on the size of the bucket.
That's it. You've got the { award ### reward ### answer ### number } .
 { This ### That ### It ### Such } is a static way presupposing every object definite and certain, i.e.
the size of the pond and the bucket should be clearly { marked ### measured ### signed ### known } .
If one of them is unknown, it will be difficult to do the measurement, let alone { another ### other ### one ### both } .
Why not change your mode of thought -- from static to dynamic , from concrete to { detailed ### easy ### simple ### abstract } ?
If you adopt an indirect way and try to find out the proportional relation between the pond and the bucket, you'll get an answer -- flexible yet { acceptable ### available ### adequate ### proper } to solve the problem.
In fact, the boy disliked { fruit ### trees ### vegetables ### sweet } , preferring a bar of chocolate if given the choice.
However, as they say, the forbidden fruit can be { difficult ### dangerous ### attractive ### healthy } .
The more he looked at it, the { sadder ### angrier ### hungrier ### cooler } he felt and the more he wanted that apple.
He stood on tiptoe, { hanging ### stretching ### beating ### pulling } as high as he could, but even as his tallest height he was unable to touch it .
He stood on tiptoe, stretching as high as he could, but even as his tallest { strength ### length ### weight ### height } he was unable to touch it .
He began to { look. ### jump ### walk ### wave } .
up and down, as high as he could, at the { edge ### stage ### top ### level } of each jump stretching his arms to get the apple .
Still it remained out of { hope ### control ### sight ### reach } .
Not giving up, he thought, if only he had something to { feed ### stand ### sit ### hold } 0n.
His school bag wouldn't give enough height and he didn't want to { break ### shake ### take ### share } he things inside, like his lunch box, pencil case, and books.
Looking { through ### forward ### down ### around } ,he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, break it was a tidy neighborhood and there was nothing he could use .
Looking stand ,he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, { so ### but ### and ### yet } it was a tidy neighborhood and there was nothing he could use .
 { After ### While ### Without ### Upon } seeing any other choices, he gave up and started to walk away.
At first he felt angry and disappointed thinking about how hungry he had become from his { lessons ### garden ### efforts ### school } ,and how he really wanted that apple.
The more he { thought ### stole ### ate ### learned } like this, the more unhappy he became.
However, the boy of our story was a pretty smart guy, even if he couldn't always get { which ### what ### how ### where } he wanted.
He started to say { with ### by ### in ### to } himself, This isn't helpful.
There's { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } more I can do to get the apple-that is unchangeable-but we are supposed to be able to thought 0ur feelings .
There's efforts more I can do to get the apple-that is unchangeable-but we are supposed to be able to { change ### express ### forget ### describe } 0ur feelings .
The { friendship ### feeling ### hurt ### talk } may not be easy to get over, but you should try.
If it wasn't your fault, then it should be easy to { forgive ### encourage ### ignore ### blame } your friend.
Tell her that her friendship is more { dependable ### valuable ### acceptable ### considerable } to you than any silly misunderstanding.
Never return to this painful { conversation ### friendship ### idea ### topic } unless she brings it up.
If the fault was yours, tell her so and { analyze ### explain ### demonstrate ### conclude } that you should never have said what you said or done what you did.
Don't send her an email or { call ### meet ### avoid ### join } her.
If you're lucky, she might { confirm ### welcome ### face ### accept } it at once ; otherwise, you will have to give her time to recover .
If you're lucky, she might accept it at once ; otherwise, you will have to give her { courage ### time ### reason ### strength } to recover .
Get your shared friends to help if your first attempt has been { offensive ### surprising ### unsuccessful ### unacceptable } .

Prove to your friend that she's worth fighting for and that you're time to show how sorry you are by being mature and { polite ### faithful ### patient ### eager } until she's ready to forgive you .
A friendship can be broken in a minute due to { unprepared ### informal ### meaningless ### careless } talk or jealousy.
A true friendship however is worth mending but take it { slowly ### seriously ### softly ### kindly } , step by step.
Tell her how { strange ### difficult ### impractical ### pointless } it would be for you to lose someone you value and respect so much.
Show her that your broken friendship must be mended because you cannot { wait ### live ### hope ### afford } to keep it broken forever.

Layers of autumn leaves create a false floor through which my trusting footsteps { break ### sink ### walk ### remove } .
Sometimes a piece of moon donates some { coldness ### light ### loneliness ### courage } to the mystery path.
But when skies are dark, there are no { vague ### typical ### visual ### conscious } clues for where I step.
Our leader { forbade ### shone ### removed ### collected } bright flashlights so we would not scare away the night creatures we hoped to find.
See with your { eyes ### toes ### hands ### feet } , the leader told us over and over again.
 { Directly ### Amazingly ### Possibly ### Luckily } , that advice took effect.
With { contribution ### appreciation ### concentration ### expectation } and courage, it didn't take long before our feet became sensitive to the ground's textures and irregularities .
With concentration and courage, it didn't take long before our feet became { suspicious ### cautious ### tentative ### sensitive } to the ground's textures and irregularities .
Toes learned to { explore ### head ### clarify ### assess } for barriers before trusting full weight on feet.
Holes and dips in the ground were detected in { need ### search ### advance ### spite } of possible fall...
But mistakes { also ### still ### even ### ever } happen.
Since the pace is { rapid ### mild ### slow ### gentle } , there is little damage except to pride.
Once { up ### down ### out ### away } , I pause to feel the firmness of earth beneath me.
The same rules often { work ### apply ### answer ### suit } for both : slow down, concentration, see with new senses -- and don't be down .
The same rules often slow for both : slow down, concentration, see with new senses -- and don't be { disappointed ### confused ### scared ### annoyed } .
Although the path is full of { darkness ### hopelessness ### anxieties ### uncertainties } -- hidden barriers, false surface, wet floor -- the earth is solid and firm beneath.
During treatment, I understood everything but the { development ### seriousness ### name ### cause } of my case.
This November of 2015 will { mark ### end ### begin ### reward } my five years off chemotherapy and I will be finally cured of cancer .
This November of 2015 will mark my five years off chemotherapy and I will be finally { warned ### informed ### suspected ### cured } of cancer .
In order to help brighten their { spirits ### future ### rooms ### way } , I created a program through which I brought celebrities children cured and respected to visit them in hospitals .

The { respect ### joy ### gift ### education } I received from being able to cured up the children's day was indescribable .
The mark I received from being able to { make ### clear ### clean ### light } up the children's day was indescribable .
This fall, I will { enter ### leave ### visit ### drop } my junior year of high school.
I love learning and I truly { kill ### save ### treasure ### waste } the time spent in school because during chemotherapy treatments I was often too spirits to attend .
I love learning and I truly cured the time spent in school because during chemotherapy treatments I was often too { young ### weak ### lazy ### busy } to attend .
Another big part of my life is { mental ### indoor ### physical ### social } activity.
During my treatment it was very hard for me to walk -- let alone { swim ### lie ### jump ### run } .
After finishing chemotherapy my main { goal ### task ### problem ### idea } was being able to run and play joy again .
After finishing chemotherapy my main admired was being able to run and play { cards ### chess ### sports ### music } again .
I'm overjoyed to say I've been able to { further ### kick ### set ### achieve } that aim.
Being able to stand on the court and play sports again is a(n) { amazing ### puzzling ### satisfying ### touching } feeling.
To me it's important to convey a { note ### message ### word ### wish } of positivity and hope that anyone can make the most of any situation in life.
Many don't { speak ### apologize ### understand ### remember } and think it's strange when I say this, but I'm truly grateful that I had cancer.
Having experienced that, I have become brave { and ### but ### or ### so } have also gained appreciation for life.
I know with determination everyone can follow their { steps ### examples ### suggestions ### dreams } .
Once as I was walking on the street, a young man ran by { excitedly ### hurriedly ### happily ### fast } , brushing against my handbag.
Even as he continued on his way, he { stopped ### held ### watched ### turned } back and said sorry to me.
One day, after I bought some apples, the salesman was giving me the change, { or ### and ### but ### so } I wasn't ready for it, and a coin dropped on the ground, I'm sorry, he said while bending down to pick it up.
I was { impressed ### moved ### annoyed ### puzzled } --why would he apologize when it was my fault ?
I was puzzled --why would he apologize when it was my { problem ### matter ### fault ### business } ?
Another time, I { moved ### stepped ### walked ### knocked } on a man's foot in an escalator .
At the same time , we both said sorry . I thought it { interesting ### acceptable ### exciting ### reasonable } at first : was it really stepped for him apologize ?
At the same time , we both said sorry . I thought it fault at first : was it really { polite ### important ### surprising ### necessary } for him apologize ?
Later on, an American friend { announced ### explained ### suggested ### admitted } to me that according to the American stepped , the escalator is a(n) interesting place which everyone should be able to stand in .
Later on, an American friend fault to me that according to the American { ideas ### rules ### opinions ### senses } , the escalator is a(n) interesting place which everyone should be able to stand in .
Later on, an American friend fault to me that according to the American stepped , the escalator is a(n) { open ### common ### public ### free } place which everyone should be able to stand in .
After someone occupies a position in the escalator, making it { unfit ### impossible ### narrow ### difficult } for someone else to find a place to stand in, isn't it necessary to stepped an apology ?
After someone occupies a position in the escalator, making it fault for someone else to find a place to stand in, isn't it necessary to { express ### speak ### say ### tell } an apology ?
During my stay in America, I gradually { realized ### remembered ### recognized ### meant } that when friction occurs in daily life, Americans don't care much about who is stepped .
During my stay in America, I gradually fault that when friction occurs in daily life, Americans don't care much about who is { mistaken ### responsible ### careless ### correct } .
If someone is { nervous ### sick ### worried ### troubled } , a sorry is always necessary.
Even if the other person is hurt, the sorry would { reduce ### cool ### lose ### change } tempers .
Perhaps this is { that ### when ### why ### how } I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses, subways or streets in America.

The past few weeks have been rather { pleasant ### simple ### tough ### common } , but when a large number of Smile Cards arrived in my mailbox the other day, having traveled all the way from the United States to my home in the Netherlands, I knew things were about to turn around .

I woke up, went to work, and afterwards, I went tough to the shop to buy some candy bars, planning to leave them as anonymous { surprise ### gifts ### notice ### intention } for people on the train .
However, { unlike ### unusual ### unsure ### unlucky } my early morning train, my train home was extremely crowded.
An elderly man must have seen me searching for a place to 49 { drop ### give ### leave ### hide } a Smile Card, because he asked me if I was looking for something.
Right then I { wondered ### decided ### doubted ### suggested } that my first Smile Card would not be anonymous.
With a big smile and cheeks 51 { filled ### faced ### satisfied ### content } with excitement, I told him that I straight what I was looking for, gifts him the candy bar and Smile Card I had in my hands .

 { Because ### Despite ### Although ### Though } having worked a full day, I almost bounced home.

I figured they both 60 { admired ### deserved ### won ### rewarded } a tasty little treat.
The occupant( ) of the { seat ### room ### car ### position } next to the one I was going for was an older man.
Taking the seat next to the man, I began to read the { map ### story ### newspaper ### book } I 'd been carrying.
The man { standing ### seated ### lying ### walking } next to me introduced himself by asking if I 'd read any other books like the one I was presently holding .
The man seated next to me introduced himself by asking if I 'd read any other books like the one I was { presently ### rightly ### frequently ### fortunately } holding .
When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and, to tell the truth, { neither ### as ### so ### such } did I.
He told me about how he loved jazz music and we { told ### shared ### changed ### wrote } many stories and a lot of laughs.
The more we talked, the more { frightened ### ashamed ### amazed ### impressed } we became at how much the two of us really had in common ,despite the age shared .
The more we talked, the more so we became at how much the two of us really had in common ,despite the age { limit ### difference ### range ### group } .
I haven't seen him since then, but the thought of our { performance ### speech ### connection ### behavior } that day never leaves my mind.
Carl really makes me think about how much we can learn from each other { though ### since ### as ### if } we just break through the barriers we've got.
I mean, I would have { often ### never ### just ### already } thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much difference than I .
I mean, I would have amazed thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much { stronger ### taller ### better ### older } than I .

My affected experience happened when I woke up early one morning because of the { smell ### shape ### taste ### sound } of water .
As I started to get out of bed to turn on the light, I felt cold muddy water at my { head ### neck ### feet ### breast } .
I then realized that the power was { out ### in ### on ### down } .
This probably happened due to the heavy { rain ### snow ### frost ### fog } and strong wind that were brought by a hurricane during the feeling .
This probably happened due to the heavy sorry and strong wind that were brought by a hurricane during the { morning ### afternoon ### evening ### night } .

Because I had only moved in the house and had only feeling a few belongings, the amount of damage was { great ### big ### small ### tiny } .

After getting off the train, they walked without an { choice ### decision ### acquaintance ### appointment } into the outer office of Harvard's president .
So they were stopped by his secretary and kept { waiting ### standing ### sitting ### talking } .
For hours, the secretary took no notice of them, { hoping ### finding ### realizing ### imagining } that the couple would finally become disappointed and go away .
The secretary finally decided to disturb the president, though { hopelessly ### carefully ### unexpectedly ### unwillingly } .
A few minutes later, the president walked towards the couple with a { pleasant ### funny ### cold ### sad } face .
The lady told him, We had a son that { attended ### visited ### studied ### served } Harvard for one year .
He loved Harvard . He was { clever ### brave ### proud ### happy } here .
The president wasn't moved .Instead, he was { satisfied ### excited ### shocked ### ashamed } .
If we did, this place would look like a { park ### cemetery ### garden ### museum } , Oh, no, the lady explained quickly .
If we did, this place would look like a cemetery , Oh, no, the lady { explained ### expressed ### refused ### admitted } quickly .
We don't want to put up a statue.We would like to give a { building ### yard ### playground ### square } to Harvard.
The president rolled his eyes and { laughed ### shouted ### glanced ### called } at the couple and then exclaimed, A building!
Do you have any { suggestion ### idea ### thought ### opinion } how much a building costs?
The president was { bored ### astonished ### interested ### pleased } , because he could get rid of them now .
Then the lady turned to her husband and said quietly, Is that all it costs to start a { department ### university ### business ### club } ?
Her husband nodded. { Once ### While ### Since ### Though } their offer was turned down .
Stanford traveled to California where they founded Stanford University { named ### looked ### taken ### followed } after them, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer Since about .

Donna was one of the volunteer teachers who participated in this { job ### project ### observation ### course } .
One day, I entered Donna's classroom, took a seat in the back of the room and { checked ### noticed ### watched ### waited } .
All the students were working { on ### with ### as ### for } a task.
Her page was half full and she showed no { scenes ### senses ### marks ### signs } of stopping.
I walked down the row and found { nobody ### somebody ### everyone ### anyone } was writing sentences, describing things they couldn't do.
By this time the activity aroused my { curiosity ### suspect ### sympathy ### worry } , so I decided to check with the teacher to see what was going on but I noticed she too was busy writing .
By this time the activity aroused my curiosity , so I decided to check with the teacher to see what was going on { and ### or ### but ### so } I noticed she too was busy writing .
I felt it best not to { insert ### interrupt ### talk ### request } .
After another ten minutes, the students were { taught ### shown ### forced ### instructed } to fold the papers in half and bring them to the front.
Then Donna { added ### wrote ### made ### folded } hers.
There they began to { cry ### pray ### dig ### play } .
The box of I Can'ts was placed at the { back ### bottom ### top ### edge } of the hole and then quickly covered with dirt.
At this point Donna announced, Boys and girls, please join hands and { drop ### raise ### fall ### lift } your heads.
Friends, we gathered here today to { keep ### thank ### forgive ### honor } the memory of 'I Can't.'
He is { remembered ### punished ### removed ### replaced } by his brothers and sisters 'I Can' and 'I Will'.
May 'I Can't' rest in { silence ### heart ### peace ### memory } .
Amen! She turned the students { down ### up ### off ### around } and marched them back into the classroom.
They celebrated the { birth ### passing ### loss ### starting } of I Can't .
On those rare occasions when a student { awoke ### reminded ### forgot ### apologized } and said, I Can't, Donna passing pointed to the paper tombstone .

When they { guessed ### discovered ### thought ### predicted } that Black Wednesday were going to perform at our local theatre, they all bought tickets for performance .
When they discovered that Black Wednesday were going to perform at our local theatre, they all bought { flowers ### drinks ### clothes ### tickets } for performance .
However, at the last minute, one of the friends couldn't go, so my brother { booked ### offered ### returned ### found } me the ticket .
I was really { relaxed ### embarrassed ### excited ### encouraged } !
I remember the buzz of excitement inside the theatre as we all found our { seats ### entrance ### spots ### space } .
After a few minutes, the lights went down and everybody became { comfortable ### quite ### serious ### nervous } .
I could barely make out the stage in the { silence ### noise ### darkness ### smoke } .
My brother leaned over and shouted something in my ear, but I couldn't { forget ### hear ### repeat ### bear } what he was saying .
The first song was already starting and the music was as { loud ### heard ### sweet ### fast } as a jet engine .
I could { feel ### touch ### enjoy ### digest } the drum beats and bass notes in my stomach .
I can't recall any of the songs that the band played . I just { realize ### understand ### believe ### remember } that I really enjoyed the show and didn't want it to feel .
I can't recall any of the songs that the band played . I just loud that I really enjoyed the show and didn't want it to { continue ### delay ### finish ### change } .
We left the { party ### theatre ### opera ### stage } and walked unsteadily out onto the pavement .
I felt a little dizzy, as if I had just { escaped ### traveled ### benefited ### woken } from a long sleep .
My ears were still { aching ### burning ### ringing ### rolling } with the beat of the last song .
After the { competition ### performance ### interview ### celebration } , I became a Black Wednesday fan too for a few years before getting into other kinds of music .
Once in a while, { though ### otherwise ### instead ### besides } , I listen to one of their songs and woken I'm back at that first show .
Once in a while, theatre , I listen to one of their songs and { decide ### regret ### conclude ### imagine } I'm back at that first show .
After 75 combat missions, his plane was { followed ### destroyed ### spied ### seen } by a surface-to-air missile.
Plumb was { released ### wounded ### captured ### killed } and spent six years in prison in Vietnam.
He survived and now { lectures ### gives ### studies ### hears } about lessons learned from that experience.
You { repaired ### made ### flew ### cleaned } jet fighters in Vietnam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk .
asked Plumb. I { bought ### checked ### found ### packed } your parachute, the man replied.
Plumb gasped in surprise and { gratefully ### suspiciously ### happily ### sadly } .The man pumped his hand and said, I guess it worked!
Plumb assured him, It { almost ### surely ### narrowly ### nearly } did--if your chute hadn't worked, I wouldn't be here today.
He says, I wondered how many times I might have passed him { abroad ### in ### on ### at } the Kitty Hawk.
I wondered how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you', or anything { so ### because ### unless ### though } , you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was just a sailor .
I wondered how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you', or anything because , you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was just a { sailor ### captain ### pilot ### technician } .
Plumb thought of the many days the sailor had spent on a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship { unwillingly ### immediately ### worriedly ### carefully } working on each chute, holding in his hands each time the sailor of someone he didn't know .
Plumb thought of the many days the sailor had spent on a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship because working on each chute, holding in his hands each time the { death ### fortune ### fate ### chance } of someone he didn't know .
Plumb asks his { wife ### children ### sailors ### audience } , Who's packing your sailor ?
Plumb asks his because , Who's packing your { luggage ### bag ### parachute ### future } ?
Plumb also says that he needed many kinds of parachutes when his plane was shot down-he needed his { psychological ### physical ### imaginary ### safe } parachute, his mental parachute, his emotional parachute, and his spiritual parachute.
He called on all these { spirits ### emotions ### supports ### people } before reaching safety.
His experience reminds us all to { award ### recognize ### reward ### help } and be kind to people who pack our daily parachutes, and strengthen us to go through fate times .
His experience reminds us all to carefully and be kind to people who pack our daily parachutes, and strengthen us to go through { happy ### tough ### comfortable ### cosy } times .
When I was thirty-five, I met my husband and came to { know ### teach ### understand ### instruct } his kids, aged 10 and 7.
Then I got { convinced ### separated ### changed ### married } .
In most { places ### ways ### cases ### families } ,stepkids live with their mom and stepdad.
This makes our case quite { unusual ### similar ### positive ### difficult } .
Four years into our marriage, after going between their mom's place and ours, the boys { came ### moved ### got ### ran } in with us full-time.
For example, { allowing ### getting ### advising ### inviting } the kids to help didn't appear an important thing before, but now they became unwilling.
Once, after I'd asked my elder stepson to set the table, he { quietly ### suddenly ### simply ### immediately } said, You're not my mother; I don't have to listen to you.
It was { selfish ### impolite ### reasonable ### painful } but I realized it was about keeping roles clear in our new family life .
It was painful but I realized it was about keeping { roles ### duties ### quarrels ### records } clear in our new family life .
I told him he was right--I wasn't his mom ; I was another person in his life who { supported ### envied ### loved ### bothered } him, and we needed to get things done roles .
I told him he was right--I wasn't his mom ; I was another person in his life who painful him, and we needed to get things done { properly ### together ### already ### easily } .
 { Still ### Even ### Also ### Then } in a life-in situation, a step-parent isn't the parent.
You help with everything and { have ### expect ### avoid ### share } lots of hugs and laughs.
But you also have to learn to stand in the { shadows ### positions ### shelters ### sufferings } .
For example, when there were only enough { spots ### beds ### chairs ### tickets } for Mom and Dad to sit up front, I sat in back.
Today, my stepsons know where to find me, whether it's for long chats or a(n) { special ### extra ### quick ### private } e-mail to say hi.
The caring is surely there, even if the { bloodline ### influence ### comfort ### respect } isn't.
We talked and talked and soon { film ### music ### sports ### play } became the topic.
Suddenly I hit upon an idea. Wouldn't it be fun to go { swimming ### skating ### skiing ### camping } ?
 { Specially ### Besides ### Really ### Clearly } , we could be healthier if we did.
I told them about this, and they all said it was a good idea { indeed ### fully ### certainly ### truly } .
Early the next morning, we four were standing at the bus stop, with bags in our hands, { looking ### searching ### waiting ### asking } for a bus to take us to the sands .
Early the next morning, we four were standing at the bus stop, with bags in our hands, waiting for a bus to take us to the { river ### lake ### pool ### sands } .
 { Even ### Yet ### But ### Just } our heavy overcoats were not enough to keep us warm.
We soon reached the sands. There was { somebody ### nobody ### everybody ### anybody } there, but we were not discouraged.
Instead we were { excited ### happy ### proud ### lonely } that we were the only ones that dared to challenge the weather.
 { So ### But ### Still ### Yet } we changed our clothes quickly.
But things were not going so { wrong ### right ### bad ### smooth } .
At { first ### all ### last ### once } we made up our minds to go into the water.
We put our feet in first { just ### then ### only ### but } to take them back very quickly.
I gave the { message ### order ### mark ### information } , and we all rushed forward and jumped in.
I was up { slowly ### nervously ### late ### immediately } and rushed again to the shore.
 { Nor ### And ### So ### Or } it was with my friends.
On the way back home, we talked about this unforgettable { idea ### experiment ### chance ### experience } .
The four of us did not { attend ### reach ### enter ### go } school for the following three days.
We all suffered a lot { by ### with ### from ### of } a very bad cold.
Sitting beside me was a { friendly ### beautiful ### powerful ### generous } gray-haired woman.
I thought she might be a { boring ### strict ### native ### former } English teacher because she impressed(...)me as a person with knowledge and confidence.
And as I { received ### borrowed ### removed ### lifted } my library book to read, I could feel her eyes carefully looking in my direction .
My thoughts kept moving from the beautiful woman to thoughts of { school ### hospital ### library ### family } .
My classmates had been { discussing ### packing ### ordering ### designing } presents to buy for each other upon graduation.
It had never { persuaded ### told ### hit ### beaten } me that kids bought presents for graduation.
My mind was still in thought when { slowly ### suddenly ### finally ### secretly } I heard some noise at the entrance doors.
There was an elderly woman in a wheelchair and another older woman trying to { roll ### carry ### pull ### push } her along.
People coming into the lobby were too busy to help them, { helping ### suggesting ### leaving ### hoping } them to struggle alone.
I eased them both sets of doors and rode with them on the { wheelchair ### elevator ### taxi ### floor } .
They thanked me. I told them it was my { duty ### responsibility ### pleasure ### relief } .
I was on my way down in the elevator { when ### until ### once ### since } I realized that I had left my backpack on the lobby chair.
My backpack had { something ### nothing ### anything ### everything } of value in it.
As I sat down, I could feel the beautiful gray-haired woman's { grateful ### sad ### amazing ### smiling } eyes on me.
She seemed proud for some { reason ### excuse ### thought ### idea } .
Then her taxi arrived, and, without a word, she was { lost ### gone ### missing ### moved } .
To my surprise, { sitting ### hiding ### lying ### living } inside my backpack was a fifty-dollar bill!
The beautiful woman with the { funny ### confident ### proud ### foolish } look in her eyes suddenly came into my mind .
The beautiful woman with the proud look in her eyes suddenly came into my { mind ### brain ### head ### life } .
One day before her birthday, she was told by her mum that a Make A Special Birthday { Poster ### Card ### Wish ### Cake } contest was being held in a radio program of the city.
If she wrote a { poem ### note ### song ### letter } to the program, she might win a big prize.
The contest sounded { fun ### ridiculous ### scientific ### familiar } , so she started thinking what she wanted most for her birthday .
The contest sounded fun , so she started thinking what she { cared ### missed ### wanted ### planned } most for her birthday .
I am nine years old. I have a { challenge ### problem ### program ### project } at school.
Can you help me? I have a special { disease ### family ### dream ### birthday } .
I just want one { day ### week ### month ### year } when no one plays jokes on me.
At the radio station in the city, the workers had fun { worrying ### thinking ### reading ### looking } about all the different presents that kids wanted on their birthdays.
When Amanda's letter arrived, the manager Mr. Tobin read it { nervously ### carefully ### helplessly ### happily } .
He knew her disease that might { attract ### disappoint ### confuse ### surprise } her schoolmates who didn't understand her carefully .
He knew her disease that might reading her schoolmates who didn't understand her { disability ### strength ### reality ### loss } .
He thought it was { impossible ### hard ### common ### good } for people to know the girl and her carefully wish .
He thought it was reading for people to know the girl and her { unknown ### unusual ### unimportant ### unexpected } wish .

To some people ,there is something greatly { pleasant ### interested ### dangerous ### terrible } about getting to the especially of a hight mountain .
To some people ,there is something greatly feared about getting to the { foot ### spot ### top ### tip } of a hight mountain .
Struggling against nature is finer than a battle { with ### to ### against ### between } other human beings.

At that time life was relatively simpler, and people were much more { friendly ### generous ### careful ### sensitive } and gentler.
Recently, to my surprise, I got the opportunity to experience that same warmth that I thought had { prevent ### removed ### lost ### disappeared } from the fast-moving world.
I was out shopping the other day with my husband, two daughters and one { niece ### granddaughter ### nephew ### son } .
We entered a restaurant, looking for some { tea ### food ### fruit ### vegetable } and comfort.
To our disappointment, all the tables were { fixed ### covered ### occupied ### set } and no one seemed in a hurry to get up .
We waited, tired and { impatient ### nervous ### awkward ### embarrassed } .
After quite some time, one table was vacated , but that could { serve ### seat ### lay ### hold } only two of us.
My daughter made me sit along with her father, while she and my other daughter { sat ### followed ### stood ### watched } alongside.
My granddaughter sat on my { shoulder ### feet ### lap ### table } as we looked all around us, waiting for another table to be available soon .
My granddaughter sat on my lap as we looked all around us, waiting for another table to be { blank ### free ### available ### clean } soon .
We decided to move to their table, { unless ### once ### before ### until } they were finished with their lunch.
Since the girls had just got their { order ### bill ### note ### menu } , I knew it would be a once wait .
Since the girls had just got their available , I knew it would be a { long ### short ### boring ### exciting } wait .
As we were deciding on what to eat, one of the girls got up and { left ### pushed ### shared ### offered } their table to us.
We were very appreciative of their kind { treat ### expression ### movement ### gesture } .
We thanked them { personally ### properly ### publicly ### sincerely } and moved to their table.
That day, I { turned ### came ### thought ### pointed } to myself there still were some kind, civil and helpful youngsters in this non-caring world, and my faith in humanity was offered .

There are now about 360 { species ### classes ### groups ### names } of sharks, whose size, behavior, and other characteristics differ widely.
Every year, we catch and kill over 100 million sharks, { greatly ### popularly ### widely ### mostly } for food and for their fins.
Dried shark fins are used to make shark fin soup, which sells for as much as $50 a bowl in fine Hong Kong { supermarkets ### restaurants ### offices ### companies } .
Sharks are vulnerable to overfishing because it { spends ### takes ### costs ### uses } most species 10 to 15 years to begin reproducing and they produce only a few offspring.
 { Impressed ### Moved ### Changed ### Influenced } by movies and popular novels, most people see sharks as people-eating monsters.
This is far from the { story ### truth ### movie ### problem } .
Most { injuries ### deaths ### attacks ### causes } are by great white sharks, which often feed on sea lions and other marine mammals.
They sometimes mistake human swimmers for their normal prey, { specially ### especially ### mainly ### usually } if they are wearing black wet suits.
If you are a typical ocean-goer, your { chances ### fears ### lives ### percentages } of being killed by an unprovoked attack by a shark are about 1 in 100 million.
You are more { likely ### frequent ### possible ### lucky } to be killed by a pig than a shark and thousands of times more likely to get killed when you drive a car.
Sharks help { avoid ### save ### keep ### prevent } human lives.
In addition to providing people with food, they are helping us learn how to { damage ### destroy ### fight ### ruin } cancer, bacteria, and viruses.
Their highly effective immune system { advises ### allows ### forces ### forbids } wounds to heal quickly without becoming infected, and their blood is being studied in connection with AIDS research.
Sharks are among the few animals in the world that almost { never ### seldom ### often ### usually } get cancer and eye cataracts.
Understanding why can help us improve human { analysis ### research ### study ### health } .
Then I { cant't ### needn't ### nustn't ### oughtn't } have worked so hard in my late twenties and early thirties.
But I just didn't { notice ### understand ### know ### recognize } that.
I can never tell my left { from ### between ### to ### on } my right.
I avoid dialing a telephone if I can help it, because I sometimes have to try three times before getting the number { well ### down ### right ### clear } .
Despite my { mistakes ### weaknesses ### faults ### difficulties } I view my dyslexia(difficulty in reading) as a gift, not a curse .
Many dyslexics are good at right brain, namely abstract thought ,and that is { when ### why ### how ### what } my king of creative writing is.
I'm starting with { something ### nothing ### everything ### anything } and coming up with something that didn't exist before.
I { attach ### devote ### owe ### thank } my career to Ralph, Salisbury, my writing instructor at the university of Oregon, who looked past my misspellings and gave me encouragement and hope .
I owe my career to Ralph, Salisbury, my writing instructor at the university of Oregon, who looked past my misspellings and gave me { adjustment ### acknowledgment ### requirement ### encouragement } and hope .
That's my strong point. I just carried on and never looked { ahead ### out ### back ### forward } .
I write { frequently ### regulary ### neatly ### quickly } .
I go like the wind and can { get ### do ### live ### pick } up to 15 pages a day.
Writing is not the { point ### problem ### reason ### purpose } .
I have no problem downloading; it is inputting { where ### that ### how ### what } things get messed up.
The real { experience ### story ### fear ### advice } I have for dyslexics is not that they have to where with messy input, but that they will quit on themselves before they finish school .
The real problem I have for dyslexics is not that they have to { compete ### struggle ### handle ### go } with messy input, but that they will quit on themselves before they finish school .
Parents have to create victories whenever they can, { whether ### unless ### either ### until } it is music, sports or the arts.
You want your dyslexic child to be able to say, Yeah, reading is { necessary ### easy ### wonderful ### hard } .

Our daughter, already in college, thought it a great idea while John, in high school, was { happy ### horrified ### grateful ### relieved } that we might be in college at the same time.
I { complained ### noticed ### explained ### declared } that things would be a little different, horrified if everyone contributed, it wouldn't be difficult .
I reactions that things would be a little different, { but ### so ### or ### for } if everyone contributed, it wouldn't be difficult .
The next day we drove to the community college and after a careful research, I chose to { fill ### join ### lead ### major } in occupational therapy .
Days passed in excitement, enrolling(register) in classes, shopping for { supplies ### clothes ### instruments ### souvenirs } and attending orientation .
I felt like a kid again, but as the first day of classes drew near, I became { determined ### confident ### anxious ### confused } .
Finally, with encouragement from my family and friends, I stuck with my { opinion ### decision ### project ### promise } .
As I entered my classroom that first morning, I chose a seat in the back, hoping to { avoid ### draw ### receive ### pay } attention.
I found the classes and assignments { annoying ### depressing ### demanding ### interesting } , and I left that day feeling I might survive.
Studying and keeping up with my duties at home was { different ### challenging ### rewarding ### simple } .
Math and science were { always ### still ### ever ### never } my strong subjects, so I devoted more time to those.
When the first semester { changed ### started ### ended ### returned } , I had a 4.0 GPA and was placed on the Honor Roll.
By the second year, Bob and the kids were all doing their { dishes ### deeds ### homework ### share } , and I had learned how to comfortably challenging my school and home life .
By the second year, Bob and the kids were all doing their interesting , and I had learned how to comfortably { balance ### save ### continue ### value } my school and home life .
As I drove away on the last day of school, I thought about what a difference returning to { family ### society ### school ### hospital } had made in my life.
I looked much younger and I had more { time ### energy ### money ### chance } and enthusiasm for life.
At the age of 8, I even became { afraid ### happy ### fond ### tired } of getting Halloween candy.
 { Hardly ### Normally ### Certainly ### Approximately } , on October 31, my twin brother and I went out and rushed to every house in the neighborhood .
 Normally , on October 31, my twin brother and I went out and { pointed ### rushed ### moved ### traveled } to every house in the neighborhood .
However, when we { knocked ### escaped ### reached ### entered } one of the bigger houses with 10 tall steps rushed to the front door, which were known to have the best candy, my fear reached me .

However, when we Normally one of the bigger houses with 10 tall steps rushed to the front door, which were known to have the best candy, my fear { encouraged ### spread ### prevented ### attracted } me .
My brother was already up the stairs, while I stood { slightly ### frozen ### calmly ### happily } at the bottom.
It was { unlikely ### unlucky ### possible ### pitiful } that I'd be able to climb all that way, for I was afraid that I might fall over in the dark and reached my bag of candy .
It was rushed that I'd be able to climb all that way, for I was afraid that I might fall over in the dark and { fall ### drop ### forget ### lose } my bag of candy .
I might { bury ### break ### tear ### catch } my clothes on something.
I wanted the candy, but there was no { way ### need ### doubt ### wonder } I would go up those stairs to get it.
I failed. I lost more than just candy. I lost my { bag ### life ### way ### confidence } .
Fear of the unknown { amused ### controlled ### helped ### ruined } me for a long time.
After six years in nursing, I was { excited ### concerned ### impressive ### unsatisfied } with the career I had chosen.
I faced a { difficulty ### cause ### fear ### choice } : step out into the unknown or drop the rest of my life at the bottom of those steps, never tear the best candy .
I faced a unlikely : step out into the unknown or { save ### spend ### change ### escape } the rest of my life at the bottom of those steps, never tear the best candy .
I faced a unlikely : step out into the unknown or drop the rest of my life at the bottom of those steps, never { presenting ### buying ### making ### tasting } the best candy .
Whenever I would lose a client , the old fears { disappeared ### warned ### returned ### reminded } .
However, I'd tasted the candy, and now I don't { fear ### cry ### fail ### complain } when I face difficulties.
I believe that, though { big ### fortunate ### bad ### small } things can happen when we step out, worse things happen when we don't.

He { felt ### knew ### heard ### noticed } large amounts of rainwater flowing down the hill, and water was also bubbling at the base of a rock on the hill.
For a few minutes, Wasana stared at the water, wondering why it looked so { dangerous ### moving ### interesting ### familiar } .
Then it hit him--the { show ### view ### scene ### scenery } was similar to the video he was shown during Disaster Management classes.
Fearing a { heading ### leaving ### going ### coming } disaster, he shouted familiar at the students waiting outside their classrooms .
Fearing a noticed disaster, he shouted { angrily ### rudely ### happily ### wildly } at the students waiting outside their classrooms .
Run, run, don't stay here! The { rock ### water ### sand ### tree } on the hill is going to fall on us!
Chaos broke out as the { villagers ### students ### principals ### climbers } ran to the open area that had been appointed as an emergency gathering point.
When some teachers { blamed ### questioned ### approached ### instructed } Wasana, he showed them the water gushing from the hill, and they started leading the students to safer ground.

 { Leading ### Demanding ### Covering ### Helping } a group of teachers and older students Gurusinghe climbed the hill and tried to make the water flow away from the rock.
They were too { nervous ### strange ### unique ### late } : ten minutes later, they heard screams as the huge rock rushed down the hill.
There was little Grrusinghe and his group could do as they watched the earth { swallow ### threaten ### affect ### blow } their classrooms.
Thanks to Wasana's { legal ### quick ### direct ### united } action and careful observation, no one was hurt in the accident.

What is it? I wondered . I { read ### thought ### turned ### passed } it over .
There,in faded ink, was a hand-scrawled { address ### 1ist ### message ### information } .
Immediately my mind traveled { forward ### so ### ahead ### back } many years.
I was nine years old, walking down the cold,wet streets of Springfield,with a bag of magazines on my shoulder.On my { return ### rounds ### trip ### arrival } that day.I came to that Company finally, whose owner, Mr. Rader,had always taken me there to ask his workers whether they wanted any magazines.
Shaking off the { dust ### sweat ### tail ### rain } like a wet dog .
After a quick glance ,he { led ### followed ### watched ### carried } me over to the fire-place .
Noticing the { hole ### mud ### water ### cover } in the top of my shoe ,he said, Come with me !
Noticing the hole in the top of my { magazine ### shoe ### sock ### bag } ,he said, Come with me !
,pulling me into his pickup { truck ### factory ### home ### store } .
we pulled to a stop before a shoe store . Inside,a salesman { dressed ### fitted ### showed ### comforted } me with the finest pair of Oxfords I had truck seen .

we pulled to a stop before a shoe store . I shoe about 10 feet tall when I got up { for ### with ### on ### in } them .
Back in his office, Mr Rader took out a { pen ### paper ### card ### notebook } ,wrote something on it, and handed it to me .
With { tearful ### unbelievable ### curious. ### puzzled } eyes,I read, Do to others as you would have them do to you .
He said affectionately , Jimmy,I want you to { admit ### know ### consider ### express } I love you .
I said good-bye, and for the first time I { sensed ### received ### lost ### gained } a flicker of hope that somehow things would be all right .
With people like Mr Rader in the world,there was hope,kindness and love,and that would always make a { deal ### fortune ### choice ### difference } .
The { praise ### challenge ### suggestion ### advice } was in deciding which son would take his place .
As his children gathered to { enjoy ### concern ### celebrate ### honor } his birthday, the father announced his retirement .
As his children gathered to celebrate his birthday, the father announced his { retirement ### experience ### money ### knowledge } .
I want each of you to { cover ### provide ### combine ### fill } it with what you believe to be the most retirement thing for our successful business .
I want each of you to celebrate it with what you believe to be the most { comfortable ### beautiful ### valuable ### adjustable } thing for our successful business .
Based on your choices, I will decide who will take { up ### over ### down ### off } the business, father saiD.
The next days the families and employees could sense the spirit of { teamwork ### achievement ### competition ### communication9. } between the boys.
It was January 1st and the family { forced ### refused ### adjusted ### gathered } to celebrate again.
Please { send ### publish ### share ### write } with me what's in your box!
The box you gave me was much too { big ### small ### light ### large } Father walked to the window and from that distance could see all .
With a deep tone of { happiness ### illness ### sadness ### loneliness } , he asked the other son, What do you have to give ?
The son { posted ### packed ### wrapped ### handed } his father the box .
The old man looked inside and with great { delight ### shock ### mystery ### devotion } looked up at his son .
It's { empty ### wonderful ### terrible ### ugly } !
I could not place { where ### when ### how ### what } I found most valuable in a box.How does one measure the value of quality and honesty?
What size box would { sensed ### measured ### hold ### compared } the loyalty of our employees and customers?
How big of a room would I need for our workers who have { benefited ### suffered ### learned ### heard } from our generous pay and health plan?
Finally, father, the most valuable possessions I { severely ### luckily ### sadly ### slightly } hold are the love of you and mother.
It was { obvious ### nervous ### anxious ### mysterious } what decision was made that day.There will come a time when each of us will be asked by our father to share what we value most.I hope your box is empty.
I found that I { fit ### matched ### suited ### qualified } for some grants .
There was enough to { cover ### offer ### contain ### include } school and books, but not enough for room and board .
My grades went up and down . It was the hardest work I had { even ### ever ### never ### still } done .
 { Everything ### Something ### All ### Anything } that was required of me was cooking meals.
My first { idea ### job ### finding ### discovery } was his grandmother' s great love of music .
One day, she told me I didn't have enough { money ### fun ### energy ### ambition } .
Grandma was { persuaded ### stuck ### impressed ### beaten } with my ability and encouraged me to continue .
When Christmas break came, Grandma got a chest cold { therefore ### then ### or ### and } I was unwilling to leave her .
I hadn't been home since Labor Day, and my family was { nervous ### surprised ### anxious ### shocked } to see me .
I said my good-bye, { settled ### recommended ### organized ### arranged } for her temporary care and returned home .
 { Before ### As ### After ### Since } I was loading my car to go back to school, the phone rang and my friend told me Grandma died .
I had { lost ### missed ### forgotten ### known } my friend, and that was far worse than knowing I would have to return to dishwashing .
I had lost my friend, and that was { far ### fairly ### very ### more } worse than knowing I would have to return to dishwashing .
I { explained ### expressed ### realized ### announced } my position, then he smiled and slid me an envelope which was from Grandma .
In the envelope was enough money to pay for the rest of my school year and a request that I take piano lessons in her { way ### need ### memory ### response } .
Now, years later, when I walk by a piano, I { smile ### cry ### leave ### escape } and think of Grandma.She is playing the piano in heaven, I am sure.
Many teenagers complain that while they do well in their homework, they don't get { high ### low ### many ### poor } marks in exams.
Researchers report that heavy exam { contents ### result ### atmosphere ### pressure } is actually more likely to affect the performance of very good students than average ones.
Worried about whether they can { please ### disturb ### succeed ### fail } others like parents and teachers, these students can lose their most valuable intellectual weapon : short-term or working memory .
Worried about whether they can please others like parents and teachers, these students can lose their most { worthless ### useless ### valuable ### expensive } intellectual weapon : short-term or working memory .
This is their ability to { remember ### recall ### remind ### prepare } numbers and ideas while finding solutions to the problem at hand.
According to the study, when { extra ### ordinary ### little ### unusually } pressure is put on people with good skills, their performance drops off.
People with strong working memory skills are very { possible ### probable ### determined ### likely } to do well in intellectual ability tests.
Their analytical skills and creative { labor ### experience ### thinking ### method } depend on their short-term-focused processor .
In the study, researchers { tested ### checked ### researched ### examined } the working memory of 93 students.
They were divided into two groups, with a high and a low { storing ### working ### changing ### speaking } memory.
The students then took two maths tests each under { unhealthy ### favorable ### hard ### different } conditions.
In the other, the students were told they were part of a team that was depending on them to { add ### develop ### rise ### improve } their score in order to win a reward.
The results showed { expected ### significant ### unclear ### disappointing } differences: the group with high working memory scored about 10 percent higher than the others on the low-pressure practice test.
But the two groups' { scores ### performances ### reports ### clocks } were about equal on the other test when the pressure was higher.
The study shows how memory performance is { prevented ### improved ### affected ### prepared } by fear of failure and the ticking clock, according to the scientists.
The affordable { shelters ### clubs ### parties ### rooms } are designed to be used by the poor as well as survivors of war and natural disasters.
By the time 2020, there's going to be about 1.7 billion people living in slums so we would like to { affect ### adapt ### effect ### adopt } change, says Stephanie Hunt, co-founder of the Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanities at SMU.
The institute, which { discovered ### helped ### studied ### explored } build the village on SMU's campus, was established to solve problem of the poor in the United States and around the world through engineering, and the free market .
The institute, which helped build the village on SMU's campus, was established to solve problem of the poor in the United States and around the world through engineering, and the free { entry ### competition ### trade ### market } .
The goal is not just to { save ### survive ### defend ### cure } lives, but to change the victims' lives.
The Institute hopes some entrepreneurs might program and { share ### donate ### earn ### cost } some money with these ideas.
One of the structures in the SMU village was built with bricks made { briefly ### relevantly ### mostly ### efficiently } from recycled plastic bags.
They're { held ### stressed ### knocked ### packed } together with heavy wires.
Harvey Lacey, father of two college-aged sons, including one here at SUM, heard about this project and { delivered ### contributed ### devoted ### sacrificed } his invention.
The advantages are that these { piles ### masses ### loaves ### blocks } weigh less than two pounds.
They're very, very { fragile ### thick ### hard ### bitter } These things can go for many generations of housing, says Lacey, who is giving away the design.
Anybody can follow his online plans to { build ### invent ### improve ### possess } the compactor that turns plastic bags into bricks.
On this warm day, it's { hot ### cold ### wet ### cool } inside the Ubuntu Blox hut, thanks build to the thick plastic insulation .
On this warm day, it's hard inside the Ubuntu Blox hut, thanks { nearly ### exactly ### partly ### fairly } to the thick plastic insulation .
Kenyan { doctor ### athlete ### photographer ### architect } Ronald Omyonga, visiting the global village before returning to his native Africa, says his country is full of these recyclable bags.
With Lacey's design, he says that litter could be transformed into { safe ### dangerous ### beautiful ### large } housing.
He dreams of other { advantages ### chances ### benefits ### profits } too.
Look at the Harvey Lacey hut, as a means of creating { things ### jobs ### wonders ### conditions } , says Omyonga.
Leaning the environment, and turning { waste ### resources ### ideas ### technology } into something that can form houses, not just for the poor.

As a result, computers are { opposed ### avoided ### ordered ### required } by all businesses for their smooth running.
It has been proved that computers improve the work productivity and { nevertheless ### therefore ### unless ### however } have become a necessary professional investment.
Originally it was in the period of 1950s { that ### when ### until ### before } computers started gaining importance in the business world.
At that time they were used to store { personal ### scientific ### logical ### financial } data.
With the popularity of computers in the commercial field, computers { happily ### hardly ### usually ### gradually } got used to perform multiple functions.
The { combination ### development ### invention ### argument } of computers with communication technology happened later which led to the creation of servers.
Websites were designed which could be { destroyed ### spread ### accessed ### made } by the internet users.
Extensive data like written documents, videos and images was { stored ### downloaded ### charged ### changed } in the enterprise servers.
Computers now perform many { easy ### simple ### complicated ### interesting } tasks.
With its presence in every small workspace, let us take a look at some of its key { uses ### branches ### sections ### techniques } .
Spreadsheet software is used for this { cause ### purpose ### process ### effect } which helps to keep a record of all profits, losses, sales and costs.
Emails are sent daily to { update ### convey ### correct ### write } official information and other software is used to create reports and memos.
Corporate advertising { profits ### staff ### managers ### materials } like print brochures are easily created with the help of computer printers.
Companies { damage ### release ### maintain ### improve } a record of their customers, products and financial dealings through the computer.
Database management software is used by the employees to { doubt ### input ### output ### analyze } the stored data, select it and use it for making reports etc.
Moreover, through the computer the company gets into a direct { track ### finance ### connection ### investment } with its bank account.
There is actually no { idea ### end ### reason ### answer } to its use.

Such as collecting stamps, and spent all my { additional ### extra ### other ### spare } time reading poetry and writing it .
This habit of { doing ### making ### writing ### praising } poetry on every possible occasion soon got me into trouble at school.
If a lesson did not interest me, I would take out my { dictionary ### notebook ### textbook ### handbook } and start writing poems in class.
Of course I did this very { anxiously ### attentively ### carefully ### silently } , but it was not long before I got notebook .
Of course I did this very writing , but it was not long before I got { caught ### lost ### gone ### stricken } .
One day while I was { busy ### ready ### careful ### happy } writing a poem during a geography lesson, I looked up to find the teacher notebook over me, looking very angry because I was not carefully attention .

He tore the poem up, with a { warning ### notice ### word ### look } not to waste time in his lesson.
All the same I was convinced that I had written a good poem, so that evening I wrote it out again from { heart ### mind ### memory ### thought } .
Not long after, I read about a poetry { contest ### quiz ### race ### meeting } and I decided to send in my caught .
Not long after, I read about a poetry carefully and I decided to send in my { poem ### composition ### papers ### homework } .
I got a letter telling me I had won first { position ### prize ### reward ### victory } .

Ricardo worked like a(an) { interesting ### independent ### mad ### great } man, from 7:30 am to midnight every day.
The doctor told him if he { changed ### continued ### dropped ### went } like that, he would find a new home in hospital.
Semler got the { sound ### way ### sense ### message } .
He changed the way he { walked ### talked ### worked ### treated } .
In fact, he changed the ways his { family ### workers ### friends ### children } worked, too.
He let his workers take more { responsibility ### money ### power ### expectation } so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong.
He { persuaded ### forced ### forbade ### allowed } them to set their own salaries,49 decide their own working hours and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary , like receptionists and secretaries .
He allowed them to set their own salaries,49 { decide ### want ### understand ### try } their own working hours and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary , like receptionists and secretaries .
He allowed them to set their own salaries,49 decide their own working hours and he cut all the jobs he thought were { unnecessary ### unpopular ### stupid ### difficult } , like receptionists and secretaries .
He changed the office:51 instead of walls, they have plants at Semco, so bosses can't { put ### get ### shut ### take } themselves away from everyone else.
And the workers are { willing ### free ### tired ### eager } to decorate their workspace as they want.
It sounds perfect,but does it { develop ### grow ### happen ### work } ?
The answer is in the { eyes ### numbers ### persons ### dollars } : in the last six years, Semco's revenues have free from $35 million to $212 million .
The answer is in the shut : in the last six years, Semco's revenues have { grown ### dropped ### beaten ### made } from $35 million to $212 million .
Semler says it's because of peer pressure which makes employees work { straight ### slow ### hard ### seldom } for everyone else.
If someone isn't doing his job { perfect ### wrong ### well ### late } , the other workers will not allow the work to continue .
If someone isn't doing his job free , the other workers will not allow the { trouble ### situation ### pressure ### suffering } to continue .
In other words,Ricardo treats his workers like adults rather than children, and expects them to act like responsible { children ### teenagers ### professors ### adults } .
When Carol was diagnosed, her cancer had { spread ### delivered ### developed ### sent } to her bones.
I reviewed choices for { directions ### medicine ### instructions ### treatment } and printed out new research.
She felt almost { same ### common ### usual ### normal } and went right back to work.
Carol hates the idea of being { looked ### considered ### thought ### felt } as a sick person.
Last winter, Carol suddenly found { this ### one ### it ### that } difficult to swallow.

 { Still ### Yet ### Then ### Even } we began an African safari, a trip she had dreamed of for years.
Morning and afternoon, we went diving and rolled into the clear water { sinking ### swimming ### dropping ### disappearing } down like peas in honey.
I could see by their { words ### voices ### faces ### actions } that they didn't really understand that kind of time.
We have been friends { longer ### older ### closer ### elder } than they have been alive.

I made lists { because ### though ### since ### while } she slept.
Cancer has become part of our { leadership ### scholarship ### friendship ### membership } .
Not knowing what comes next means { everything ### nothing ### anything ### something } is possible.
Perhaps I will be hit by a truck, or my heart will stop. Life is { dangerous ### colorful ### difficult ### different } .

Upon { boarding ### leaving ### approaching ### seeing } the plane, I noticed a boy who was around eight years old, sitting in the window seat next to mine.
Trying my best to be { quiet ### helpful ### famous ### friendly } , I said hello and introduced myself, and he told me his name was Bradley.
We started a { discussion ### conversation ### interview ### game } and within minutes, he took me into his confidence, saying, This is the first time I have ever been on a plane.
I'm a little bit { happy ### nervous ### shy ### sad } .
I managed to { encourage ### persuade ### blame ### comfort } him.
As we ascended , he looked out of the window and started describing excitedly everything he was { planning ### experiencing ### covering ### showing } .
Then he told me he needed to go to the bathroom, { so ### because ### or ### but } I stood up to let him out into the aisle.
Bradley, { continuously ### gladly ### slowly ### peacefully } made his way down to the bathroom and back.
Sitting back down, he { imagined ### pretended ### complained ### explained } , I have muscular dystrophy , and so does my sister, who's in a wheelchair now .
Sitting back down, he explained , I have muscular dystrophy , and so does my sister, who's in a { school ### wheelchair ### company ### village } now .

As we descended , he looked over, smiled, and spoke in a low, almost explained voice, You know, I was really { careful ### concerned ### doubtful ### excited } about who would sit beside me on the plane .
I was afraid it would be someone who didn't want to { play ### meet ### agree ### talk } with me.
I'm so { amazed ### glad ### sorry ### angry } I sat beside you.
Thinking about the whole experience later that night, I was reminded of the { value ### hope ### secret ### way } of being open to the moment.

I saw that he had not 37 { also ### already ### ever ### yet } gotten his drink so I went over and 38 offered to help .
I saw that he had not 37 yet gotten his drink so I went over and 38 { pretended ### offered ### refused ### stopped } to help .
He was blind. Then I took him by the hand and led him to the 39 { room ### kitchen ### street ### table } .
I asked him if he needed anything else and he said he was fine, so I 40 { stayed ### continued ### left ### followed } .
Two hours later, I was 41 { struggling ### heading ### fighting ### praying } for my car and the rain started pouring down, and then I saw the young blind man.
He was trying to 42 { cross ### find ### clean ### avoid } the street and using his stick to make sure that nothing was in his way.
He pressed the button 43 { as ### but ### though ### so } the light would turn red and allow for a walking 44 cross .
He pressed the button 43 heading the light would turn red and allow for a walking 44 { mark ### signal ### warn ### sign } .
He was hesitant about crossing the street and just 45 { watched ### smiled ### nodded ### stood } there.
He smiled and said, Hey! You are the young lady who helped me at the 46 { school ### house ### restaurant ### centre } .
Then I took the 47 { disabled ### sick ### funny ### injured } man's hand and led him across the street.
He said he does fine but he never crosses the street 49 { slowly ### alone ### immediately ### finally } in the rain because he can never 50 stood if a car is coming since he can't hear so well over the sound of the 51 restaurant .
He said he does fine but he never crosses the street 49 signal in the rain because he can never 50 { ask ### prove ### explain ### tell } if a car is coming since he can't hear so well over the sound of the 51 restaurant .
He said he does fine but he never crosses the street 49 signal in the rain because he can never 50 stood if a car is coming since he can't hear so well over the sound of the 51 { machine ### car ### rain ### thunder } .
I asked him how he knew I was the 52 { usual ### same ### strange ### common } person from the restaurant.
He said that he remembered my energy and he could 53 { use ### imagine ### touch ### feel } it just like before!
I smiled as we 54 { exchanged ### remembered ### understood ### accepted } introductions for the first time.
We made it to the other side of the street and he told me he was 55 { happy ### tired ### safe ### busy } now and could make the rest of the way on his own.

She told them to go to the Detroit Public Library to read a { notice ### message ### book ### question } a week and do a report about it for her.
One day, in Ben's { class ### room ### office ### lab } , the teacher held up a rock and asked if anyone knew it.
Ben { looked ### gave ### took ### put } up his hand and the teacher let him class .
Ben book up his hand and the teacher let him { think ### leave ### stand ### speak } .
They wondered. He { always ### even ### quickly ### never } said anything; what could he possibly want to say?
Well, Ben not only { found ### played ### knew ### threw } the rock; he said a lot about it.
The teacher and the students were { afraid ### surprised ### worried ### unhappy } .
Ben had learned all this from doing one of his book { pictures ### exercises ### shops ### reports } .
Ben later went on to the { top ### end ### back ### side } of his class.
After Ben had grown up, he learnt something about his mother that he did not know as a { doctor ### child ### student ### teacher } .
It was my first day at school. I felt { frightened ### generous ### nervous ### excited } and scared.
I went to all my classes with no { textbooks ### teachers ### friends ### classmates } .
It felt like no one { cared ### mattered ### understood ### helped } .
I listened anxiously to all the lessons and waited for lunch { hours ### stop ### period ### break } at one.
Then finally the bell rang. It was time to talk and have { rest ### fun ### food ### discussion } .
In the lunch line I met a new friend who wore a hijab on her head, and though I am { Spanish ### Arab ### Russian ### Jewish } , we got along well, and I was so relieved when she said, Sit with us, at our table .
In the lunch line I met a new friend who wore a hijab on her head, and though I am Jewish , we got along well, and I was so { worried ### relieved ### anxious ### bored } when she said, Sit with us, at our table .
So I { adapted ### adopted ### agreed ### admitted } , and took my plate and was relieved to walk with her across the floor, when suddenly I felt a nudge .
So I Jewish , and took my plate and was { about ### ready ### willing ### likely } to walk with her across the floor, when suddenly I felt a nudge .
I see your Jewish star necklace. You { might ### would ### could ### should } sit with us.
At that moment I looked around, and that's when I { saw ### noticed ### knew ### recognized } , to my surprise, the nations of the world, agreed themselves .
At that moment I looked around, and that's when I relieved , to my surprise, the nations of the world, { developing ### expanding ### separating ### defending } themselves .
The Spanish only sat with Spanish, the Hindus only with Hindus, the Russians always with the Russians, and { only ### always ### sometimes ### never } the Arabs with the Jews.
I saw the reason why { conversations ### friendships ### wars ### arguments } got started.
Everyone { stuck ### catered ### turned ### objected } to their own kind.
The { table ### classroom ### restaurant ### lunchroom } was a map of the world.
Why was everyone so { quiet ### blind ### deaf ### tough } ?
And so I turned { down ### up ### off ### away } this girl, and went with the first, and there was no enmity .
I built a { tunnel ### platform ### bridge ### path } between two worlds when I sat with those wars from me .
I built a never between two worlds when I sat with those { opposite ### different ### separate ### apart } from me .
As I climbed out of the { pond ### sea ### pool ### river } , after witnessing my time in the 100 yard freestyle, I did not feel like speaking to anyone.
I saw the bright smiles of swimmers who had just { made ### achieved ### reached ### realized } a best time.
 { Otherwise ### However ### Besides ### Overall } , I had failed.
I was lying on my cool bed when an idea { occurred ### broke ### came ### hit } me.
Success is the { opportunity ### action ### cause ### ability } to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm .
Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your { enthusiasm ### interest ### strength ### friendship } .
At practice the next day, I told my swimming teammates about my goal time and they all either laughed or replied with a { somehow ### somewhat ### anyhow ### anywhere } similar response like, You can't do it or Probably not .
Believe it or not, these are the responses that make my goal { available ### reasonable ### reliable ### achievable } .
Finally came the day when I had to { promise ### provide ### present ### prove } to myself and others that with achievable there is no limit to your achievements .
Finally came the day when I had to somewhat to myself and others that with { consideration ### Impression ### belief ### desire } there is no limit to your achievements .
I felt the cool water running { through ### above ### across ### to } my back.
I swam like a fish, bouncing off each { turn ### jump ### struggle ### shoot } at the wall as if it was a spring board.
On the { next ### previous ### very ### last } turn, I came back to the wall with every piece of strength I had.
I { pushed ### reached ### got ### touched } the final wall with my fingertips and I knew that I had swum the across race .
I belief the final wall with my fingertips and I knew that I had swum the { whole ### perfect ### first ### best } race .
I had achieved my best time! Joy filled my { heart ### head ### mind ### mood } like water does a cup.

It is made up of 46 mountains with a { length ### height ### width ### depth } of over 4,000 feet.
The Adirondack Mountain Club gives special honor and a patch to { something ### someone ### anything ### anyone } who climbs all 46 mountains.
My two friends decided to go for this { fame ### award ### medal ### gift } .
The left one was the farthest, { requiring ### making ### wasting ### paying } much effort.
A hiking trail led past the base of the mountain, { and ### even ### so ### but } from that point they were on their own.
Early one morning they left their { village ### house ### camp ### cottage } and walked 5 miles on the hiking trail to the base of a chain of mountains .
Early one morning they left their camp and walked 5 miles on the hiking trail to the base of a { series ### lot ### chain ### kind } of mountains .
One of the mountains in this chain was the last one they { needed ### prepared ### looked ### hunted } for their patch.
When they reached the base of the mountain chain they { understood ### thought ### forgot ### discovered } that they had left their compass and map back in the camp.
For hours they { rushed ### rolled ### walked ### ran } uphill suffering heat and black flies.
Finally, late in the afternoon, they { relaxed ### congratulated ### enjoyed ### found } themselves on the top of a mountain.
They were tired but { excited ### surprised ### disappointed ### puzzled } .
They had climbed the { high ### right ### wrong ### small } hill!
It was too late that weekend to correct their { direction ### wrong ### decision ### error } .

Before the million-copy { novels ### sales ### prints ### stories } of The Joy Luck Club, The Kitchen God's Wife and The Hundred Secret Senses, Amy Tan was a writer--a business writer.
She and a partner { cooperated ### enjoyed ### rushed ### ran } a technical-writing business with lawyer-like billable hours .
Her { role ### position ### idea ### ability } with customers was largely that of account management-- but this daughter of immigrants wanted to do something more creative with words, English words .

Her role with customers was largely that of account management-- but this daughter of immigrants wanted to do something more { creative ### changeable ### stressful ### difficult } with words, English words .
So she decided to talk to her { friend ### partner ### boss ### father } , I want to do more writing.
He { demanded ### explained ### complained ### declared } her strength was doing estimates, going after contractors and collecting bills.
It was { wonderful ### unforgettable ### horrible ### crazy } stuff.
The very stuff Tan hated and knew she wasn't { hardly ### really ### sincerely ### occasionally } good at.
But her partner { insisted ### suggested ### knew ### realized } that writing was her weakest skill.
I thought. I can { dismiss ### respect ### believe ### expect } him and just keep doing this or make my demands.
So she { agreed ### cheered ### struggled ### argued } and stood up for her rights.
He would not give in. Shocked, Tan said, I { dismiss ### quit ### drop ### retire } .
And he said: You can't quit. You're { fired ### astonished ### successful ### skillful } !
And added, You'll never make a dime(ten cents)writing. Tan set out to { keep ### remain ### prove ### turn } him wrong, taking on as many assignments as she quit .
And added, You'll never make a dime(ten cents)writing. Tan set out to argued him wrong, taking on as many assignments as she { should ### may ### must ### could } .
Of course, being on her own was rather { satisfied ### ashamed ### tough ### easy } .
But not letting others limit her or define her { cases ### talents ### work ### future } made it worthwhile.
And on her own, she felt { free ### troublesome ### bitter ### grateful } to try fiction.
And the manager who couldn't write became one of America's bestselling, best-loved { managers ### immigrants ### contractors ### authors } .
Hubby and I had been a two-income family { from ### before ### at ### by } the time we were married.
It didn't occur to me that we would be anything else though it's hardly news that the choice has its { benefits ### challenges ### shortcomings ### privileges } .

The woman who cared for the kids in our { separation ### conflict ### adjustment ### absence } was truly a gift from God.
Nan and I { influenced ### suspected ### shared ### ignored } values and parenting styles.
Never underestimate the value of { routine ### independence ### cooperation ### schedule } .

But I think we would have lost something just as important as my { income ### children ### passion ### life } .
My work at the News Sentinel has been { fun ### tiring ### dull ### demanding } and exciting.

I'd had some { difficulty ### trouble ### questions ### problems } in school, so my parents decided to let met work full-time with my dad.
We both worked for my uncle, who had taken { advantage ### possession ### position ### place } of a road maintenance company.
It was up to us to keep the roads { away ### from ### far ### clear } of rubbish.
The job was { easy ### exciting ### smelly ### comfortable } and dirty, especially on hot days like this.

In many ways, a diary and a blog are very { simple ### special ### similar ### different } .
But what makes bolgging different from writing in a(n) { personal ### ordinary ### meaningful ### traditional } diary?
The biggest difference is that a blog is much more { attractive ### public ### exciting ### quick } than a diary.
Usually, a teenager treats his diary like a book full of { thoughts ### puzzles ### ideas ### secrets } that he does not want to share with others .

I have a little sister, and sometimes I go online to read her { blog ### diary ### report ### web } .

She writes about things like waking up early for swimming practice and not studying enough for her chemistry test. share I was her age, I wrote about the same things, but { only ### already ### still ### never } in my dairy .
Then, after I had finished writing, I would hide my diary in a secret place because I was { angry ### sad ### glad ### worried } that my sister might read it.
The biggest { problem ### doubt ### question ### mistake } with blogging is that anyone can read what you write.
If I was angry with a friend during high school and wrote something { boring ### wrong ### mean ### funny } about him in my diary, he would never know.
 { So ### However ### Therefore ### Then } , if my sister ever wrote something bad about a friend, that friend might worried her blog and get angry .
 only , if my sister ever wrote something bad about a friend, that friend might { steal ### break ### write ### read } her blog and get angry .
There are also { reasons ### wishes ### shortcomings ### advantages } to blogging, of course.
If I was feeling sad one day and wrote in my diary, Nobody cares about me , because no one would { care ### know ### think ### ask } about it.
However, if my sister wrote the same sentence in her blog, her best friends would quickly { prepare ### begin ### respond ### feel } and tell her how much they mean her .
However, if my sister wrote the same sentence in her blog, her best friends would quickly problem and tell her how much they { like ### miss ### need ### stand } her .

I can get to the station quite { hard ### early ### easily ### late } because there's a to the station.
But in the summer, it can get quite smelly because of all the { rubbish ### boxes ### bottles ### paper } .
So I always try to { walk ### pass ### go ### rush } through it.
Today I was trying to do so as usual { so ### therefore ### when ### because } something made me stop for a moment.
I saw the most beautiful { back ### act ### mark ### color } by an old woman walking in front of me with the help of a white stick .
I saw the most beautiful act by an old woman walking in front of me with the help of a white { bike ### stick ### dog ### umbrella } .
She was short and { weak ### rich ### clever ### sad } and had white hair.
She was walking { quickly ### happily ### angrily ### slowly } as each step took some effort.
She slowly placed her walking stick { in ### around ### against ### under } the rubbish bin.
She clearly found it { unable ### difficult ### different ### impossible } and it took her a while.
All the while she used the rubbish bin to { warm ### help ### support ### hide } herself.
She threw the rubbish inside the bin and then { continued ### started ### enjoyed ### remembered } walking.
There's no much rubbish and no one ever does { something ### anything ### everything ### nothing } about it.
I was moved to { feel ### see ### have ### let } this old woman make such a great effort to keep even a small part of it anything !
I was moved to continued this old woman make such a great effort to keep even a small part of it { busy ### beautiful ### dirty ### clean } !
I haven't been able to { keep ### stop ### mind ### regret } thinking about that all day.
I've decided to pick up rubbish of the { wall ### desk ### ground ### classroom } if I meet from now on.
In my enthusiasm and { anger ### sorrow ### nervousness ### excitement } I talked slightly louder than usual voice and in Spanish, my mother tongue.
A few minutes into the { call ### restaurant ### discussion ### interview } the lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly offended , and asked the restaurant staff to relocate her to a table as far away as possible from the man who wouldn't get off his phone .
A few minutes into the call the lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly { informed ### cheered ### offended ### separated } , and asked the restaurant staff to relocate her to a table as far away as possible from the man who wouldn't get off his phone .
I sank in my seat out of { enthusiasm ### embarrassment ### disappointment ### satisfaction } .
I ended the call soon afterwards and felt the urge to go over and { donate ### cooperate ### apologize ### exchange } .
Before getting up I looked around to see where she was and she was, { instead ### indeed ### again ### also } , at the table furthest away from me.
I noticed that the lady was { moved ### thankful ### proud ### alone } and staring out of the window.
I { arranged ### ignored ### broke ### detected } a tinge of sadness----perhaps a desire for aloneness and peace.
But I had { obviously ### naturally ### pleasantly ### purposefully } destroyed it minutes earlier.
Right then I { prepared ### abandoned ### suggested ### enjoyed } my plans for a conventional apologetic gesture.
On signing my restaurant bill I asked my server to { partly ### eventually ### secretly ### formally } charge the lady's meal to my credit card and hand her the Smile Card instead of her bill.
Did she take it the wrong way, I { wondered ### discouraged ### expected ### continued } ?
Did she get confused? Did she refuse the anonymous { service ### point ### advice ### offer } ?
I just waited and felt nervous to learn the { approach ### outcome ### difference ### reason } .To my pleasant surprise, things turned out to be the best possible way.
The waiter approached me in a stream of { pity ### doubt ### joy ### sorrow } , telling me, In many times she had outcome there before, but we had never seen the old lady smile as she did upon joy the Smile Card and the $0check .
The waiter approached me in a stream of offer , telling me, In many times she had { quarreled ### worked ### smiled ### dined } there before, but we had never seen the old lady smile as she did upon joy the Smile Card and the $0check .

She thanked me even though I { explained ### suspected ### argued ### complained } that someone else did the job.
Last night I was driving from Harrisburg to Lewisburg, a { flight ### distance ### road ### length } of about eighty miles.
However, if anyone asked me how fast I was { thinking ### driving ### complaining ### running } ,I'd say I was not over-speeding.
Several times I got { stopped ### changed ### stuck ### lost } behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, and I was holding my fists tightly with impatience .
Several times I got stuck behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, and I was holding my fists tightly with { horror ### strength ### understanding ### impatience } .
I was alone on the road by now, but as I { passed ### watched ### approached ### found } the light, it turned red and I braked to a stop.
Not a car, no suggestion of headlights, but there I sat, waiting for the light to { stop ### change ### turn ### die } , the only human being for at least a mile in any approached .
Not a car, no suggestion of headlights, but there I sat, waiting for the light to impatience , the only human being for at least a mile in any { way ### side ### city ### direction } .
Nothing. I started { wondering ### suspecting ### struggling ### regretting } why I refused to run the light.
I was not afraid of being { abused ### fine ### injured ### killed } , because there was obviously no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no change in going through it .
I was not afraid of being approached , because there was obviously no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no { danger ### sign ### time ### record } in going through it .
It's not only the { virtue ### suggestion ### law ### order } , but it's an arrangement we have, and we trust each other to change it : we don't go through red lights .
It's not only the approached , but it's an arrangement we have, and we trust each other to { honor ### solve ### break ### judge } it : we don't go through red lights .
Like most of us, I'm more likely to be { stopped ### protected ### rejected ### frightened } from doing something bad by the social convention that disapproves of it than by any law against it.
It's amazing that we ever { suspect ### trust ### teach ### care } each other to do the right thing, isn't it?
And we do, too, Trust is our { only ### first ### lucky ### living } preference.
I was so { sorry ### doubtful ### sure ### proud } of myself for stopping for the red light that night.

In fact, figuring out who will get the bill is always a { headache ### tradition ### plan ### conflict } for Chinese people at formal meals.

Many of us are never without our phones { although ### because ### if ### so } they are convenient.
And person-to-person mobile payment services are incredibly { easy ### expensive ### difficult ### complex } to use and at the same time save the trouble of dealing with change, said 18-year-old Han Chen, a student from Senior High School.
Why would someone place that sign so { high ### low ### tight ### loose } ?
Ah, a house for sale. A good way to grab your { audience ### heart ### money ### attention } , I said to myself.
That little { dog ### clerk ### girl ### boy } and her mom are doing it.
With { curiosity ### difficulty ### trouble ### joy } , I approached them.
Excuse me. Why are you { building ### placing ### designing ### repairing } the house for sale signs so close the ground?
I asked. The woman smiled, We're not selling the { house ### store ### sign ### car } .
Look closer. I stooped down { before ### since ### until ### when } I could finally read the small print.
We miss you! I read out aloud. I looked up and said, I don't { buy ### get ### mind ### consider } it!
You miss the house? { Stand ### Turn ### Walk ### Look } to the left.
I said, Do you { mean ### like ### hate ### draw } the dog?
Come home! I didn't understand. I must have had that { disappointed ### excited ### confused ### annoyed } look on my face.
My daughter's dog got { sold ### lost ### killed ### painted } , the woman explained.
But most people would { hang ### collected ### check ### keep } a lost sign where people could actually see it, I said .
But most people would hang a lost sign where people could { still ### even ### hardly ### actually } see it, I said .
I told my daughter that it may be { necessary ### important ### easy ### hard } to find her dog, as you can see the store has so many signs posted.
So she said that she had a better { idea ### pet ### choice ### chance } .
She wanted her dog to { miss ### find ### leave ### protect } her, she said.
And hanging them { over ### along ### down ### up } there...
What a great idea! I said to her. I { sent ### delivered ### rewarded ### handed } the woman one of my business cards.

I have always promised myself that I will never drive if I have drunk alcohol previously , no matter the { color ### taste ### quantity ### brand } .
Still, half a year ago I made this { decision ### mistake ### conclusion ### prediction } of driving after having drunk two beers at my friend' s .
Then I drove home, since it wasn't very { far ### long ### high ### fast } .
I thought that there would be no { postman ### spaceman ### caveman ### policeman } , because it was very late at night.
However, to my surprise, I was { moved ### stopped ### followed ### forgotten } and left without my driving license for three months.
I told my parents nothing at the beginning , but then I had to invent a lie, because I did not have the { time ### patience ### strength ### courage } to tell them that I had drunk alcohol and that was the real reason for which I was left without my driving license.
Those three months seemed to pass very { slowly ### quickly ### closely ### peacefully } for me, because I had got into the stopped of driving almost daily and I really needed my car quite often .
Those three months seemed to pass very policeman for me, because I had got into the { way ### habit ### race ### trouble } of driving almost daily and I really needed my car quite often .
I had to take a { bus ### bike ### taxi ### boat } and I didn't like it as I spent lots of money.
It was, indeed, a( n) { question ### opportunity ### competition ### punishment } for me not to have my driving license and I told myself never to repeat this mistake.
Apart from this, being drunk while driving { escapes ### reduces ### represents ### changes } a real danger not only for the driver, but also for slowly .
Apart from this, being drunk while driving courage a real danger not only for the driver, but also for { lookers-on ### passers-by ### grown-ups ### baby-sitters } .
Car accidents caused by alcoholism are very { strange ### complete ### necessary ### frequent } nowadays.
Teenagers especially use alcohol { before ### though ### while ### whether } going out with friends and then return home driving their cars.
They are very irresponsible as they put their lives and health in danger and, therefore, I advise people to { enjoy ### avoid ### keep ### consider } drinking alcohol before driving.
But mostly, I believe it's OK to be { dependent ### free ### sensitive ### different } , and to stand up for who and what you are.

I individual on my own that sixth grade was the { time ### chance ### case ### occasion } I should start wearing the hijab .
I was { disappointed ### scared ### enthusiastic ### angry } about what the kids would say or even do to me.
I thought they might make fun of me, or { still ### already ### even ### ever } be scared of me and pull off my headscarf.
Kids at that age usually like to be all the same, and there's little or no { rejection ### ignorance ### awareness ### acceptance } of differences.
On the first day of school, I put all those { negative ### optimistic ### serious ### strange } thoughts behind my back and walked in with my head held high.
I was holding my breath a little, but { often ### inside ### only ### outside } I was also proud to be a Muslim, proud to be wearing the hijab, proud to be different.
I was { concerned ### particular ### wrong ### convinced } about everything I thought the kids would say or even do to me.
Most of the kids would come and ask me questions -- { respectfully ### cautiously ### suspiciously ### critically } -- about the hijab and why I wore it.
I did hear some kids were making fun of me, { and ### so ### but ### or } there was one girl----she wasn't even in my class, and we never really talked much---and she spoke in favor of me, and I wasn't even there!
This is the { significance ### beauty ### value ### power } of America.

Callum, who had to re-learn { everything ### nothing ### something ### anything } , has come a very long way from the day he nearly died from the accident.
Back then, his parents were living every moment with the fear they might { affect ### lose ### harm ### shock } him.
Mum Jan said: He wasn't expected to survive { or ### so ### while ### because } his injuries were so severe.

One night I felt so { joyful ### fearless ### powerless ### shameless } that I got down on my knees and prayed for help.
I'm giving the whole thing of my son { down ### up ### without ### beneath } to you.
I was at work when I got a phone call. A man introduced himself as the { headmaster ### teacher ### adviser ### classmate } .
Before he could say { other ### holy ### more ### another } word, I choked up and all my disappointment and headmaster over Blair came another out into the ears of this stranger .
Before he could say up word, I choked up and all my disappointment and { belief ### compromise ### sadness ### recognition } over Blair came another out into the ears of this stranger .
Before he could say up word, I choked up and all my disappointment and headmaster over Blair came { pouring ### leaving ### pumping ### figuring } out into the ears of this stranger .
I've tried everything to get my boy back to school { so ### though ### if ### but } nothing has worked.
It's out of my hands. For a moment there was { disguise ### amazement ### worship ### silence } on the other end of the another .
It's out of my hands. For a moment there was headmaster on the other end of the { rope ### line ### room ### block } .
Blair's next academic record showed a big improvement in his { grades ### class ### reference ### conservation } .
In his fourth year, I { joined ### confirmed ### attended ### appeared } a parent-teacher meeting with Blair.
I thought I'd play a joke but when I heard what you said, it really { destroyed ### injured ### hit ### harmed } me how much I was hurting you.
That's when I knew I had to make you { scared ### proud ### disappointed ### nervous } .
I love my work. Now, my { father ### mother ### grandpa ### grandma } is quite ill.
He is 71 and has heart failure, and a lot of other medical { puzzles ### difficulties ### matters ### problems } .
Up until April of this year, he was able to { sit ### live ### stand ### stay } alone, drive, and take care of himself.
His health has { gone ### burnt ### come ### broken } down swiftly.
Being the only girl and a { nurse ### doctor ### daughter ### child } put me at the top of the caregiver list.
I have to abandon my own { hobby ### major ### family ### hope } to be here with Dad.
I know this is what I need to do but it is still { easy ### hard ### bad ### bitter } .
I want to spend all of the time that I can with him because I know that our { money ### pleasure ### emotion ### time } left together is short .
. At the same time, I felt { angry ### calm ### excited ### anxious } that my brothers don't help more .
Sometimes, it is days between their { trips ### visits ### calls ### meals } .
My eldest brother does { need ### have ### help ### want } some.
My other { brothers ### relatives ### sisters ### uncles } pop in for 10-15 minutesvisits.
It is really annoying. They say they can't { suggest ### stop ### stand ### help } seeing Daddy this way, which I understand .
It is really annoying. They say they can't stand seeing Daddy this way, which I { misunderstand ### understand ### share ### appreciate } .
It is really annoying. It hurts me to see him so sick and { tired ### exhausted ### weak ### dirty } , too.
As one of the world's oldest holidays, Halloween is widely celebrated with different names in many { countries ### states ### towns ### provinces } .
Although it originated as a religious holiday, it has lost its { late ### early ### religious ### close } connection in the United States.
It is now { made ### celebrated ### congratulated ### greeted } largely as a children's holiday, and many American children look forward to it for days and weeks beforehand.
The orange pumpkin, harvested at this time of the year, is hollowed out, a funny fact cut into it, and a { candle ### picture ### lamp ### flashlight } is placed inside as a decoration in the window.
City folks, nowadays, sometimes use paper pumpkins for { fun ### pleasure ### decoration ### example } .
Some years ago, the holiday was celebrated by dressing up in strange and frightening clothes and { playing ### doing ### making ### putting } tricks on one's neighbors and friends, such as ringing door bells, throwing bits of corn on the window panes , and in other ways of making little trouble .

More recently, children come to the door to have friends and neighbors admire their clothes and guess { who ### whoever ### what ### which } they are behind the strange masks and receive treats of candy, fruit or cookies.

This practice has even more recently { occurred ### moved ### developed ### processed } into an important international activity.
Instead of or along with candy, the children { gather ### collect ### make ### earn } money for UNICEF(United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund).
This { usual ### rare ### special ### common } collection of money by children for needy children throughout the world is known as UNICEF Trick or Treat .

And { as ### until ### unless ### though } otherwise assigned a seat by the teacher, I always chose to sit at the back of the classroom .
And unless otherwise assigned a seat by the teacher, I always { hoped ### agreed ### meant ### chose } to sit at the back of the classroom .
All this { continued ### changed ### settled ### started } after I joined a sports team.
At first I thought it was a crazy { idea ### plan ### belief ### saying } because I didn't have a good sense of balance, nor did I have the changed to keep pace with the others on the team and they would tease me .
At first I thought it was a crazy chose because I didn't have a good sense of balance, nor did I have the { right ### chance ### ability ### patience } to keep pace with the others on the team and they would tease me .
But for the teacher who kept insisting on my { going ### looking ### cheering ### applying } for it , I wouldn't have decided to give it a try.
Getting up the courage to go to the tryouts was only the { point ### half ### rest ### basis } of it!
When I first started { enjoying ### preparing ### attending ### watching } the practice sessions, I didn't even know the rules of the game, much ability what I was doing .
When I first started idea the practice sessions, I didn't even know the rules of the game, much { less ### later ### worse ### further } what I was doing .
Sometimes I'd get { committed ### motivated ### embarrassed ### confused } and take a shot at the wrong direction--which made me feel really stupid.

I practiced and practiced. Soon I knew the { steps ### orders ### rules ### games } and the moves .
Very soon the competitive { role ### part ### mind ### value } in me was winning over my lack of confidence.
With time, I learned how to play and made friends in the { process ### operation ### movement ### situation } --friends who respected my efforts to work hard and be a team player.
With my { expressed ### improved ### preserved ### recognized } self-confidence comes more praise from teachers and classmates.
I have gone from { dreaming ### playing ### relaxing ### hiding } in the back of the classroom and not wanting to call attention to myself, confused raising my hand--even when I sometimes wasn't 100 percent Fortunately I had the right answer .

I have gone from less in the back of the classroom and not wanting to call attention to myself, confused raising my hand--even when I sometimes wasn't 100 percent { lucky ### happy ### sure ### Satisfied } I had the right answer .
Through the years I would { guess ### believe ### doubt ### notice } at the correct answer.
When I was younger, I thought { love ### health ### sight ### sound } very important to us, so I said, My ears, mum.
She said, No, many people are { blind ### invisible ### deaf ### thoughtful } .
Since making my first { discovery ### decision ### advice ### attempt } , I had often thought over the question.
She said, You are { thinking ### learning ### growing ### changing } fast, but the answer isn't correct because there are blind people.
 { Over ### Till ### Beyond ### Before } the years, mother asked me a couple more times and always her response was, No, but you are getting smarter , dear .

 Over the years, mother asked me a couple more times and always her response was, No, but you are getting { stronger ### taller ### nicer ### smarter } , dear .
When it was our { turn ### duty ### pity ### chance } to say our final good-bye to Grandpa, Mum asked me, Do you know the important body part yet, my dear?
I was { satisfied ### shocked ### interested ### excited } when she was asking me.
I always thought this was a { test ### secret ### match ### game } between us.
She saw the { worried ### regretted ### puzzled ### pained } look on my face and told me This question's very important.
It shows you have really { lived ### found ### disliked ### enjoyed } your life.
She said, My dear, the most important body part is your { feet ### shoulders ### hands ### hair } .
she replied, No, it is { how ### why ### because ### whether } on them a crying friend or a loved one can lived their head .
she replied, No, it is puzzled on them a crying friend or a loved one can { put ### carry ### leave ### rest } their head .
I hope you'll have a shoulder to cry { on ### by ### above ### for } when you need it.
Then and there I understood the most important body part is not a { valuable ### selfish ### useful ### precious } one.
I couldn't { describe ### take ### talk ### speak } The greatest things I did find there were his parents.
We sat on the ground for lunch because they didn't have a dining { room ### car ### table ### hall } .
His mother served us very delicious food, smiled throughout and showed care for the { desirable ### healthy ### temporary ### entire } lunch session.
His father worked as a normal { doctor ### mechanic ### lawyer ### teacher } and I wondered if he earned enough money to support their two sons.
My friend had no { comment ### hesitation ### worry ### expectation } about his father and made the introductions.
Before I could say anything, the father very gently and kindly { borrowed ### bought ### brought ### took } it for me, after going through many staircases even though he was looking tired .

The amount of money you make won't { win ### get ### gain ### defeat } other's hearts; the only way is with love and kindness.
If you have strong willpower, goals and also the attitude of hard and smart work, you can { possibly ### hardly ### suddenly ### definitely } be a successful person in some areas of life.
One day, when I was in high school, I saw a kid named Kyle walking home from school with all his books, I thought to myself, { How ### When ### Why ### Where } would anyone bring home all his books for the weekend?
He must really be { stupid ### clever ### wonderful ### anxious } .
They ran at him, { throwing ### knocking ### taking ### snatching } all his books out of his arms and he fell down in the dirt.
His glasses went { lost ### sending ### broken ### flying } and landed in the grass.
 { While ### As ### Because ### Once } I handed him his glasses, he looked at me and said, Hey, thanks!
Kyle was the { top ### hardest ### favorite ### luckiest } student of our class, one of those guys that really found themselves during high school.
Therefore he had the { pride ### honor ### pleasure ### chance } to prepare a graduation speech.
On the graduation day, I could see that he was { excited ### nervous ### proud ### crazy } .
Graduation is a time to { reward ### remember ### thank ### congratulate } those who helped you make it through those tough years .
Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those { happy ### exciting ### old ### tough } years .
Your parents, your teachers... but mostly your friends, I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best { chance ### gift ### help ### favor } you can give him.
He had planned to { kill ### enjoy ### test ### hurt } himself over the weekend and was carrying his books home.
Thankfully, nothing happened. My friend { protected ### freed ### warned ### saved } me from doing the unspeakable.
Not until that moment did I realize that you should never underestimate the { price ### use ### power ### meaning } of your actions.
We may { imagine ### practice ### devote ### dream } these random acts of kindness , but we never know what happens next.
I was returning from a trip { when ### why ### whether ### that } I stopped to refuel and get snack at a gas station.
It was late. I was { clever ### tired ### lazy ### poor } , and home was still more than two hours away.
I was feeling { down ### well ### upset ### disappointed } , and my back hurt from all the driving .
I was feeling down , and my back hurt from all the { driving ### running ### swimming ### walking } .
I went { outside ### away ### off ### inside } .
The checker smiled at me, and we { believed ### explained ### shouted ### chatted } for a moment.
I don't remember { exactly ### surprisingly ### carelessly ### unluckily } what she said, but I do remember the chatted she showed me .
I don't remember inside what she said, but I do remember the { interest ### kindess ### shame ### pity } she showed me .
I was { hungry ### refreshed ### crazy ### angry } by her kindness.
The receipt reminded me of the clerk's { feelings ### warmth ### stedngth ### interests } , and it had the address of the store.
I decided to { check ### book ### write ### copy } a thank-you note to her manager.
In the letter I told the manager that his employee's kind words and caring attitude stood out to me, { designing ### repairing ### taking ### brighttening } my trip home.
A week { ago ### later ### since ### lately } , that clerk wrote me back.
As a result of my note, she got a(n) { operation ### suggestion ### employment ### praise } from her manager and a company award.
I was { successful ### shocked ### satisfied ### convenient } .
Mother Teresa { advised ### forced ### suggested ### demanded } us to do small things with great love .
Oftentimes, when we do such small things, we don't get to see the effects of our kind words or deeds, { as ### though ### so ### but } every so often, we're blessed to discover the positive outcome.
Having worked with an experienced { waitress ### assistant ### cook ### manager } for a few days, I was allowed to wait tables on my own .
Having worked with an experienced waitress for a few days, I was { promised ### invited ### allowed ### advised } to wait tables on my own .
All went { well ### quickly ### safely ### wrong } that first week.
When Saturday night came, I was luckily { left ### shown ### brought ### given } the tables not far from the kitchen.
 { Therefore ### However ### Otherwise ### Finally } , I still felt a little hard to carry the heavy trays .
Before I knew it, the { kitchen ### street ### restaurant ### table } was full of people.
I moved slowly, { changing ### minding ### taking ### saving } every step.
I remember how { angry ### calm ### sad ### happy } I was when I saw the tray stand near the tables.
It looked different from the one I was { fixed ### trained ### loaded ### waited } on.
It had nice handles, which made it { slower ### lighter ### quieter ### easier } to move around.
I was pleased with everything and began to { believe ### agree ### regret ### pretend } I was a natural at this job.
Then, an old man came to me and said, Excuse me, dear, my wife and I loved { letting ### making ### watching ### having } you work.
It seems your tray stand has been very { unusual ### familiar ### useful ### interesting } to you, but we are getting ready to watching now, and my wife needs her useful back .
It seems your tray stand has been very believe to you, but we are getting ready to { rest ### order ### eat ### leave } now, and my wife needs her useful back .
It seems your tray stand has been very believe to you, but we are getting ready to watching now, and my wife needs her { bag ### walker ### tray ### coat } back .
At first his { message ### praise ### idea ### need } did not get across.
I wanted to get into a hole and { lie ### hide ### defend ### stay } .
Since then, I have learned from many mistakes such as the one I just { repeated ### discovered ### corrected ### described } .
I have learned to be more { careful ### patient ### honest ### practical } and not to be too sure of myself.
But his fame came { soon ### late ### quickly ### early } in his life.
He was forty { since ### until ### before ### after } Americans began to read his poems and praise them.
Once his { fame ### name ### poem ### family } was set up, however, it grew stronger and stronger during the rest of his long life.
His success came from { working ### using ### putting ### uniting } traditional forms of poetry with American words, spoken in a clearly American way .

Frost used the same speaker for many poems, so the { old ### separate ### famous ### excellent } poems formed a larger unity.

He felt that his readers would believe his poems if he put the words into the mouth of a spoken person who lived in the country, not the { city ### village ### state ### continent } .

Frost, the spoken , tried to become the imaginary person he { loved ### respected ### admired ### created } for his poetry .
He was born there in 1874. He lived in California during his early { childhood ### writings ### work ### paintings } .
This man who was born in the { East ### North ### West ### South } and became linked with New England was named for the chief southern general in American's Civil War.
Someone once asked another American { teacher ### writer ### painter ### leader } , Ernest Hemingway, how to become a writer.
The { quickest ### worst ### best ### hardest } thing, he said, was to have an man childhood .
The city thing, he said, was to have an { exciting ### interesting ### unlucky ### unhappy } childhood .
If this is true, Robert Frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very { good ### poor ### young ### able } writer.
I { wanted ### expected ### hoped ### enjoyed } playing with them, but still, secretly, I hoped for a store-bought doll like the one our rich cousin had .
I enjoyed playing with them, but still, secretly, I hoped for a store-bought { doll ### toy ### girl ### baby } like the one our rich cousin had .
Her doll { might ### should ### could ### dared } open and close its blue glass eyes and even say Mamma .
I { often ### never ### sometimes ### seldom } stopped admiring it and hoping to have one.
However, my dream { immediately ### firstly ### hardly ### finally } came true when I was six.
One day my father came back from his business trip with three { beautiful ### lovely ### store-bought ### new } dolls!
They were { total ### real ### like ### unlike } store-bought dolls.
We each chose one and I named { my ### one ### them ### mine } Misako.
Soon my sisters and I became devoted { sisters ### fathers ### friends ### mothers } .
Our children kept us { free ### busy ### hard ### tired } all day.
Several months later, they got more like real children --their { faces ### legs ### arms ### hands } and bodies became dirtier; their dresses got stained; their hair less smooth.
But, by then, my sisters' interests seemed to have moved into { tiny ### different ### curious ### humorous } toys.
One had { hurt ### wounded ### lost ### damaged } one of her arms, and the other was one-legged.
Therefore, I had { two ### few ### many ### three } dolls.
They were more or less handicapped and they often looked at me as if they needed me to { teach ### feed ### satisfy ### help } them.

 magical , she didn't get what the wise man wanted, even without a signal word of { praise ### comfort ### respect ### regret } .
And they began to { describe ### exchange ### afford ### decorate } all the tragic things that recently had happened to them.
The woman said to herself, Who is better able to help these poor and { unfortunate ### unfriendly ### unimportant ### unfamiliar } people than I, though I also have had misfortune of my own?
But { whenever ### whatever ### however ### wherever } she turned, in small cottages or in other places, she found one known after another of sadness and misfortune .
But Fetch she turned, in small cottages or in other places, she found one { excuse ### story ### lie ### reason } after another of sadness and misfortune .

When I entered Berkeley, I hoped to earn a scholarship.Having been a Straight-A student,I believed I could { take ### discuss ### cover ### get } tough subjects and really learn something.
One such course was World Literature given by Professor Jayne.I was extremely interested in the ideas he { sought ### presented ### exchanged ### obtained } .
When I took the first exam,I was { shocked ### worried ### scared ### anxious } to find a 77,C-plus, on my test paper, for English was my best subject,I went to Professor Jayne, who listened to my arguments but remained unmoved .

When I took the first exam,I was shocked to find a 77,C-plus, on my test paper, for English was my best subject,I went to Professor Jayne, who listened to my arguments but remained { unchanged ### unpleasant ### unfriendly ### unmoved } .
I decided to try harder, although I didn't know what that { reflected ### meant ### improved ### affected } because school had always been easy for me.I read the books more carefully, but got another 77.
Again,I { quarreled ### reasoned ### bargained ### chatted } with Professor Jayne .
Again,he listened patiently but wouldn't change his { attitude ### mind ### plan ### view } .
One more test before the final exam . One more { choice ### step ### chance ### measure } to improve my grade .
So I redoubled my efforts and for the first time { memorized ### considered ### accepted ### 1earned } the meaning of the word thorough .
But my { ambition ### confidence ### effort ### method } did no good and everything chance as before .
But my mind did no good and everything { stayed ### went ### worked ### changed } as before .
No matter what { grade ### answer ### lesson ### comment } I got, it wouldn't cancel three C-pluses .
I might as well kiss the { scholarship ### course ### degree ### subject } goodbye .
The night before the final,I even { helped ### favored ### treated ### relaxed } myself to a movie .
The next day I decided for once I'd have { fun ### luck ### problems ### tricks } with a test .
He { happened ### proved ### pretended ### seemed } to be expecting me.
If I gave you the As you { valued ### imagined ### expected ### welcomed } ,you wouldn't continue to work as hard.
I stared at him, { remembering ### guessing ### supposing ### realizing } that his analysis and strategy were correct.
I had worked my head { out ### over ### on ### off } , as I had never done before.
Timmy sold magazines. One day he walked up to a { house ### factory ### school ### company } that people rarely visited.
No one answered. As he was ready to { come ### stop ### leave ### shout } , the door was slowly opened.
Do you { collect ### sell ### make ### repair } dog figures?
Timmy felt { happy ### calm ### nervous ### sorry } for Mr. Black, as it seemed that he was a very lonely person.
While saying this, Timmy { tried ### pretended ### continued ### seemed } to find it when Mr .
Black said { weakly ### angrily ### gladly ### strangely } , I don't need any magazines !
Timmy was so sad that he { refused ### learned ### decided ### realized } not to sell anything that day.
He went home and then had a(n) { idea ### message ### suggestion ### opinion } .
He wanted to { give ### throw ### mail ### leave } it to Mr. Black.
Seeing him, Mr. Black said that he didn't { have ### need ### accept ### understand } magazines.
He { wrote ### thought ### spoke ### heard } of the past experiences.
I'm so sorry! was my { rule ### reply ### step ### truth } .
Then he said, Excuse me too ... I didn't even { see ### tell ### get ### take } you.
We were very { nervous ### alike ### polite ### confident } , the stranger and I.
Then we went on our ways after saying { welcome ### thanks ### hello ### good-bye } .
But at home, a different { story ### message ### notice ### activity } is told.
How we treat our { crazy ### loved ### blind ### brave } ones, the young and the old.
Later, in the kitchen, as I cooked our supper, my { mother ### husband ### daughter ### son } entered, very still.
Get out of the way! I { smiled ### looked ### shot ### shouted } at her.
She left, with her little heart broken. I didn't { lie ### care ### attack ### realize } how hard I'd spoken.
That { noon ### afternoon ### evening ### night } , as I lay awake in bed, God's quiet voice spoke to me and said, While with strangers, you are polite, but with those you love, you didn't do it properly .
That night , as I lay awake in bed, God's quiet voice { looked ### pointed ### spoke ### listened } to me and said, While with strangers, you are polite, but with those you love, you didn't do it properly .
That night , as I lay awake in bed, God's quiet voice spoke to me and said, While with strangers, you are polite, { when ### but ### unless ### besides } with those you love, you didn't do it properly .
Go and look right now on the { kitchen ### bedroom ### dinning-room ### library } floor, you'll find some flowers there by the door.
Those are the flowers she { brought ### bought ### stole ### paid } for you.
She picked them herself--pink, yellow and blue. By this time, I felt { excited ### sad ### happy ### great } and small and now my own kitchen fell .
She picked them herself--pink, yellow and blue. By this time, I felt but and small and now my own { leg ### head ### tears ### feelings } fell .
I quietly went to her bed, { Look ### End ### Dress ### Wake } up, my dear daughter.
I said, I'm so { brave ### lazy ### sorry ### excited } that I missed them today ... And I shouldn't have shouted at you that way.
She whispered , Mommy, that's okay. I still { hate ### love ### miss ### beat } you anyway.
All these { stories ### talks ### tears ### dreams } were for one simple reason: I really, really didn't want to leave China.
But, I already had my plane ticket, and my work visa was { due ### ready ### lost ### special } , so I had no choice but to go back to America .
But, I already had my plane ticket, and my work visa was due , so I had no { idea ### choice ### right ### time } but to go back to America .
For a while, I was { excited ### worried ### surprised ### curious } to be reunited with my family, my friends, and most importantly, my dog.
I also enjoyed catching up on all the films, TV shows, and music I'd { ignored ### heard ### forgotten ### missed } .
Soon after I arrived home, I began { working ### talking ### living ### arguing } with my family and my friends .
I told them how I loved my { research ### stay ### business ### condition } in China, and how I hoped to come back one day.
And now here I am, { spending ### wasting ### finding ### finishing } one whole year teaching oral English at Harbin No.
1 High School. My { everyday ### recent ### previous ### wide } teaching experience gave me much spending that I am now putting to use .
1 High School. My stay teaching experience gave me much { wisdom ### pleasure ### wealth ### knowledge } that I am now putting to use .
I now feel { careful ### concerned ### certain ### anxious } about my teaching abilities that I even have a teaching philosophy.
I try to make the students { speak ### write ### listen ### read } for much more of the class period.
I also like to play games in class ,as well as doing art projects, acting, and { naturally ### generally ### hardly ### simply } having discussions.
To teach English as a foreign language in a non-English-speaking country can be quite { amazing ### challenging ### interesting ### disappointing } at times.
I feel it is probably more difficult for students to relate to the material if they are not often { questioned ### encouraged ### supported ### surrounded } by English.
Making things even more difficult is the { message ### fact ### feeling ### thought } that the English they do come across is often simply , or, while grammatically correct, is not at all native-sounding .
Making things even more difficult is the speak that the English they do come across is often { impossible ### unusual ### incorrect ### unknown } , or, while grammatically correct, is not at all native-sounding .

I noticed one of the { passengers ### pilots ### hostesses ### hosts } leave the plane.
The captain made the usual { declarations ### directions ### speeches ### announcements } : altitude , weather, arrival time, my name.

He was already dressed in a policeman's clothes long { before ### over ### since ### during } the end of the first scene.
He certainly looked the part all right, he thought as he { recognized ### showed ### admired ### found } himself in the mirror.
Just for { joke ### fun ### play ### exercise } , of course.
Then he suddenly felt { curious ### proud ### sorry ### nervous } .
After all, it was his first time to have a part in a play How could he { face ### guess ### look ### discover } all those people watching the play?

A knock on the door made him { wake ### stay ### dress ### look } up.
Have I missed my part and { directed ### performed ### ruined ### wrote } the play for everybody?

The first grade teacher gave her class fun work to draw a picture of { anything ### something ### nothing ### everything } for which they were thankful.

These, the teacher thought, would be the { homework ### subjects ### classes ### thoughts } of most of her students' art.
But Douglas made a { good ### encouraging ### different ### exciting } kind of picture, for Douglas was a different kind of boy.
He was the teacher's true child of pity and love, { merry ### naughty ### weak ### lively } and unhappy.
One could only guess the pain Douglas felt { behind ### beside ### before ### around } those sad eyes.
When he was { ordered ### told ### forced ### spoken } to draw a picture of something for which he was thankful, he drew a behind ---nothing else .
When he was weak to draw a picture of something for which he was thankful, he drew a { gift ### person ### hand ### wonder } ---nothing else .
Just an empty hand. His picture brought out the heated { thought ### laughter ### eyes ### discussion } of his classmates.
One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer because farmers { keep ### need ### buy ### sell } turkeys.
And so the discussion went --- until the teacher { always ### almost ### usually ### therefore } forgot the young artist.
 { Before ### Because ### Since ### When } the children had gone on to do other work, she turned to Douglas' desk, bent down, and asked him whose hand it was.

In 1968, { scientist ### manager ### reporter ### businessman } Spencer Silver was working with different types of adhesives .

I { offered ### attempted ### failed ### preferred } to take my daughter to the local playground.
As soon as we got there, my daughter headed for the { balls ### flowers ### swings ### crowds } and asked for a push.
Her elderly grandmother was sitting quietly on a nearby bench and { glared ### smiled ### screamed ### laughed } at me.
I walked over to the little girl and { asked ### wondered ### thought ### explained } if she could use a push, too.
She smiled and said Yes! I soon had her { hands ### feet ### arms ### head } flying towards the clouds while she laughed happily .
She smiled and said Yes! I soon had her feet flying towards the clouds while she laughed { gently ### roughly ### happily ### bitterly } .
For the next two hours I found myself { pulling ### shaking ### making ### pushing } swings and playing games with my daughter and the little girl.
By the time we headed home, I was { mentally ### simply ### physically ### mostly } worn out, but my spirits were still flying higher than those swings.
Two years later after a long day's work I went to pick up my kids from the local grade school. { Puzzled ### Satisfied ### Tired ### Worried } , I stood in the parents' waiting area physically for my children .
Two years later after a long day's work I went to pick up my kids from the local grade school. pushing , I stood in the parents' waiting area { calling ### speaking ### caring ### watching } for my children .
 { Suddenly ### Finally ### Fortunately ### Nervously } , I felt two tiny arms around my stomach.
I looked down and there was the little girl from the { stadium ### playground ### classroom ### school } smiling up at me.
She gave me one more big { kiss ### touch ### blow ### hug } before heading off to catch her school bus.
 { As ### Although ### Until ### Since } I watched her back, I didn't feel quite so tired anymore and my Suddenly were once again rising in the Heavens .
 watching I watched her back, I didn't feel quite so tired anymore and my { thoughts ### memories ### spirits ### feelings } were once again rising in the Heavens .
In this life,every single bit of love we share { clears ### finds ### fights ### feels } its way back to us again.
The law of love, { instead ### besides ### therefore ### though } , is never broken.
The love we share, the kindness we give and the { image ### idea ### joy ### value } we create will always come back to bless us.
First,a tumor on her stomach got worse,and she was very { lazy ### lonely ### painful ### shameful } .
Then,the pain in her back got so bad that sometimes she { would ### should ### might ### could } lie down in the middle of a walk and couldn't take another step .
Then,the pain in her back got so bad that sometimes she would lie down in the middle of a walk and couldn't take another { walk ### step ### foot ### breath } .
She was more like a sister to me than a { tool ### toy ### baby ### pet } .
But I was also angry at my stepfather,Steve,who told us the { plan ### accident ### anecdote ### truth } a week after it happened .
He { lied ### waited ### reflected ### hesitated } because he didn't want to worry us,and he didn't want me to get depressed and fail my exams .
I just thought she was { still ### once ### even ### never } at the animals' hospital .
I think you know all the { facts ### opinions ### thoughts ### doubts } that went through my head:She was my dog!Why didn't he tell us earlier?I didn't even get to say goodbye.
People in my family have a { story ### secret ### habit ### hobby } of keeping things from me to protect me,such as only telling me that my aunt had cancer thoughts she had already improved .

All I could think was : Not again ! I { adjusted ### turned ### contributed ### related } to my mum,and she said, I know .
I'm { angry ### shocked ### guilty ### abused } ,too .
I opened my mouth to shout.And then she added, I'm so angry with Steve that he had to { break ### go ### look ### push } through all this on his own.
Hearing my mum's words,I shut up my mouth . I had been so { focused ### hooked ### dependent ### hard } on myself .
I hadn't thought about { that ### where ### what ### which } Steve was going through .
He'd had her for longer than he'd had us--and he had to make the decision to { save ### expand ### make ### end } her life,and then kept in silence for an entire go .
He'd had her for longer than he'd had us--and he had to make the decision to angry her life,and then kept in silence for an entire { year ### month ### week ### day } .
That dog was his baby . All my anger melted away,and all I felt was { regret ### blame ### sorrow ### sympathy } .
It makes me realize that we focus so much on ourselves that we { shared ### ignored ### reminded ### rid } the pain of others .
At that moment,my mum's words were an incredible { comfort ### compromise ### gift ### suggestion } that I'll never forget .
One evening, a student { dropped ### gave ### threw ### brought } a penny at him.
Dad picked it up and put it into the { pocket ### bag ### drawer ### glass } .
The teens saw that and { called ### laughed ### cried ### greeted } , and another one another penny.
When my father had 12 cents in his pocket, he said, Guys, I want to { punish ### thank ### scold ### praise } you.
All I need is 38 more of these and I'm going over to the Fairfield and have a draft beer- { for ### in ### on ### to } you.
He could see the { satisfaction ### excitement ### shame ### horror } in their faces : Man, I'm not going to buy the TEACHER a drink !
He could see the horror in their faces : Man, I'm not going to buy the TEACHER a { drink ### gift ### penny ### present } !

But I also learned horror he would call a useful life skill : Sometimes you need to use { jokes ### tricks ### penny ### blame } to solve a problem .

Check the Father's Day greeting { card ### letter ### words ### notes } section and you'll see plenty of references to cash not growing trees and the need to check one's oil regularly.
You'll also read a lot about golf, TV remotes and { games ### naps ### cash ### program } .
My dad had zero interest in sports and { nearly ### also ### rarely ### always } had the time to watch television.
However, he may have { got ### taken ### made ### thought } the idea of the efficient nap, which he called considered 20 .

Before October 16, 2013, I was the most { casual ### considerate ### determined ### cautious } person in the world.
I never { hoped ### thought ### planned ### sensed } that anything bad could happen to me or my friends.
Then one day my best friend David pulled me aside and broke down in { anger ### excitement ### rags ### tears } .
He said he was infected with AIDS and was { leaving ### going ### dying ### changing } .
David was only 17. I had never felt so { thoughtful ### careful ### meaningless ### powerless } in my whole life.
There was { something ### nothing ### anything ### everything } we could do but watch him weaken.
 { death ### pain ### illness ### stress } was sure to come and quickly.
There were so many things that I wanted to do and say, { and ### so ### but ### or } couldn't find the words.
So, I pushed all my { emotions ### strengths ### bravery ### happiness } aside and was strong for him.
Soon David was put in the { school ### hospital ### ambulance ### avenue } .
This gave him the feeling that there was no more { cure ### treatment ### courage ### hope } left.
He looked at me and said, Faye, I am dying; let's { suspect ### tolerate ### accept ### reject } that.
All I want you to do is to remember me, { possess ### enjoy ### respect ### create } life and be careful.
June 5, 2014 { sighed ### signaled ### showed ### marked } the end of David's life.
He went { peacefully ### gradually ### patiently ### steadily } .
In a way I was { embarrassed ### shameful ### disappointed ### glad } that it was over, for he was no longer in pain.
I now { consult ### tease ### educate ### entertain } people about AIDS, and David is still with me and always will be, in mind and spirit .

He was a great American { doctor ### player ### writer ### inventor } .He was in school for only a short time.
He worked hard and hardly { forgot ### remembered ### finished ### observed } to have a rest.
He { showed ### pushed ### introduced ### threw } the young man to Edison.
He said the young man had studied in a famous university in Germany and had a lot of { news ### books ### knowledge ### dictionaries } of physics and maths.
Edison was glad to work with a man like him and { employed ### asked ### made ### watched } him as a helper.
A few weeks later, the young { beard ### learned ### read ### told } about Edison's past.
He began to look down on him. Edison was told about it, but he said { something ### everything ### nothing ### all } .
He stood near the table { but ### and ### as ### while } he didn't help him.
Edison stopped to bring out a bottle and said, Go to calculate its volume and tell me the { result ### way ### idea ### opinion } in two hours.
At first the young man thought it easy to do it. Soon he { knew ### saw ### learned ### found } it difficult.
Of course he couldn't compute the volume in the time { given ### followed ### said ### taken } .
Why not pour some { oil ### salt ### water ### food } into the bottle?
said Edison. Then you'll { carefully ### slowly ### easily ### quietly } calculate its volume!
Having heard this, the young man's { head ### face ### eyes ### ears } turned red, and he knew Edison was really cleverer than him!
Only twenty-four hours before, I had been { playing ### dealing ### equipping ### combining } with it in our farmhouse.
How quickly things { began ### worked ### changed ### increased } !
I have never known my mother to be { hopeless ### encouraged ### dissatisfied ### pleased } .
In fact, my whole family has always been { friendly ### busy ### comfortable ### positive } .
The { hurt ### hit ### burden ### duty } was so heavy to us.
Days passed and the situation didn't become { easier ### better ### faster ### worse } .
After moving to the temporary house, my father told me dealing with this would cost { extra ### private ### huge ### pocket } money.
It brought about a wave of { sadness ### nervousness ### peace ### thought } and life became a struggle.
 { Generally ### Finally ### Secretly ### Suddenly } , all my classmates stood up.
Tony, we know what 51 { existed ### continued ### remained ### happened } a few days ago.
This is not something you have to go through { straight ### alone ### naturally ### socially } .
Almost every student in our school { believed ### accepted ### donated ### paid } .
We love you and we want you to have this. She { presented ### shared ### helped ### handed } me with the box.
My eyes were filled with { curiosity ### judgment ### words ### tears } , and I had never been so moved.
I had felt so lonely for the days after the fire that I became { patient ### disappointed ### silent ### confident } , unwilling to communicate with others.
But these people looked past the rudeness I had { shown ### offered ### returned ### labelled } them.
They were my true friends and by sharing this { belief ### interest ### experience ### practice } , they were my family.
Yes, things are getting back to { subject ### reality ### nature ### normal } .
But what I learned from this journey of discovery will { stay ### compare ### connect ### agree } with me forever.

Yes, she said. And I can { recognize ### study ### read ### understand } them all by myself now!
Wow, { amazing ### amusing ### frightening ### pleasing } !

After finishing seventh in a national match in his junior year, not nearly as well as he had hoped, he knew he had to do { anything ### nothing ### everything ### something } .
I took a { breathe ### break ### departure ### throw } from wrestling for a little while, he said.
I was burnt out. I let all the { pressure ### emotion ### energy ### worry } get to me.
At the end of the match, he had { struck ### threatened ### defeated ### protected } national champion, Matt McDonough, 7-1.
While some people have { recognized ### suggested ### suspected ### explained } the idea of going to the Olympics, the Arizona State University senior says his wrestling career is over.
He's ready for the next 51 { content ### passage ### paragraph ### chapter } in his life.
I've had a { great ### natural ### careful ### traditional } time with wrestling.
I've done { which ### that ### where ### what } I set out to do.
I really want to be able to turn around now and help other people achieve things in their lives that others might say are { disappointing ### ridiculous ### impossible ### impolite } , he said.
That { happened ### grew ### changed ### started } when I moved to the wooded hills of Oregon many years later.
For the first time, I { built ### met ### caught ### ignored } animal communities.
One evening, a nursing raccoon with four kids { appeared ### waited ### shouted ### slept } .
I was attracted by their cuteness, so I { secretly ### instantly ### directly ### suddenly } put out a serving of fresh cat food and water.

They must have gotten { requirements ### expectations ### agreements ### complaints } , he said.
OK, I'm going to { stop ### keep ### delay ### consider } feeding the animals, I said.
Although I told myself that the wildlife around me would { survive ### practice ### suffer ### compete } without cat food, I felt guilty.
Then a scene outside { escaped ### attracted ### deserved ### avoided } my attention: There, on the hillside, was my neighbor.
She was { pulling ### washing ### protecting ### feeding } two deer in the cold.
Another animal { trainer ### watcher ### lover ### owner } , I thought.

The student did as his teacher { planned ### imagined ### requested ### promised } .
How often have you seen me practice the sport of archery? Raman asked him { angrily ### calmly ### disappointedly ### sadly } .
And you have { never ### almost ### always ### also } managed to hit the rose from three hundred paces away.
With his eyes covered by the { cloth ### handkerchief ### paper ### leaf } , Raman placed his feet firmly on the ground and drew back the bowstring with all his strength.
Aiming at the rose on the { ground ### branch ### tip ### root } , he let the arrow fly.
The arrow whistled through the air, { and ### for ### so ### but } it did not even hit the tree, missing the target by a few meters.
Did I { touch ### learn ### miss ### hit } it?
No, you missed { completely ### suddenly ### quickly ### carefully } , replied the student.
I thought you were going to { show ### give ### offer ### lend } me the power of thought and your ability to perform magic.
I have { again ### even ### just ### seldom } taught you the most important lesson about the power of thought.
When you { buy ### find ### notice ### want } something, concentrate only on that: No one will ever hit a target they cannot see.
As I rushed among the tables, suddenly, a { voice ### sound ### noise ### tune } asked if I could mind a child.
I was quite { pleased ### frightened ### annoyed ### interested } but I could tell the man was quite desperate .
So I had to make a { deal ### decision ### promise ### date } with him that if he wanted his son to stay and wait for him, he had to buy something in the shop .
So I had to make a deal with him that if he wanted his son to stay and wait for him, he had to { leave ### buy ### do ### eat } something in the shop .

This was quite deal for the man to do ; I could buy he was quite poor by the { manner ### means ### method ### way } he was dressed .
It looked as if he had tried to come in his { poorest ### best ### prettiest ### oldest } clothes.
Looking down I could see his { socks ### gloves ### pants ### shoes } were also a bit shabby and the heels were in a terrible state.
In the end he bought a small box of { sweets ### cigarettes ### cookies ### cakes } for his little son and seated him down in the corner.
I could tell the boy was feeling down and only could { laugh ### speak ### do ### help } with a bit of cheering up.
Seeing that the kid sat there for quite a while, I was a bit { relaxed ### nervous ### satisfied ### worried } as the poor little kid was sitting best his own .

She described a situation where her son while { on ### at ### in ### under } attack, was with his comrades moving toward their objective.
 { Mistakenly ### Eagerly ### Totally ### Nervously } , he stepped over a mine ( ).
He was fortunate, however, his friend was not so { mad ### patient ### lucky ### quick } .
The impact was immediate--his { emotion ### pain ### reaction ### scream } was more severe than anything he could describe.
All he knew was that he was in a different place, wondering to himself, Is this what { suffering ### floating ### dying ### dreaming } feels like?
The next thing he { thought ### imagined ### forgot ### remembered } was hearing a slight groan ( ) coming from nearby.
Looking over his { .shoulder ### arm ### head ### hand } he noticed it was his friend, lying on the ground .

Getting up quickly, he made his way to what he now { hoped ### realized ### impressed ### regretted } was only a bad dream.
Unfortunately, his friend was { sick ### real ### anxious ### stubborn } ; it was not a dream.
As he bent over to help, he knew he was his friend's only { friend ### doctor ### help ### love } .
This dying soldier needed his full { attention ### power ### courage ### energy } .
It would be only minutes, maybe seconds and his { attack ### battle ### journey ### life } would be over.

One year, my five-year-old daughter Jeanine gave me a { surprise ### gift ### help ### something } .
It was a soft toy penguin with a hand -painted { picture ### book ### card ### postcard } saying I love My Dad!
Tears came into my eyes and immediately, I gave it a { special ### lovely ### flat ### big } place on my desk.
Soon I had to leave on another business { occasion ### trip ### meeting ### day } .
This time when I was { leaving ### unpacking ### packing ### working } , I put the penguin in my suitcase.
Many years { passed ### went ### flew ### crossed } by and that little penguin has traveled with me hundreds of thousands of miles all across America and over to Europe.

After that, I just remember her voice { explains ### explained ### explain ### explaining } the importance of a good handshake, conveying a positive sense of self, looking at the other person in the eye, making that first moment matter .
. . I think in that exchange I first understood { politeness ### saying ### friendship ### respect } .
I respected her for { costing ### spending ### taking ### using } the time to teach me about one of those subtleties in life.
I appreciated the fact { what ### which ### that ### / } she didn't look down upon me because I was 11 or because I didn't know something.
I mean the { place ### position ### way ### time } she treated me.
I also appreciate her idea that if someone doesn't pay attention to something, be patient and point him or her { from ### at ### in ### to } the right direction.
I am not interested in other people's { broken ### unwanted ### frozen ### desired } items.
My mother was, and she convinced me to { accompany ### attach ### arrange ### accomplish } her.

 { Tears ### Happiness ### Promises ### Laughter } welled up in my eyes.
There at her home, among all her { aims ### belongings ### figures ### exhibitions } , was a piece of my life that she had nurtured .
In that moment, she taught me more about life than I could { need ### plan ### imagine ### guess } .
We seldom envision the { senses ### benefits ### effects ### pains } that we have on others' lives.
That piece may grow and spread, becoming a (n) { appropriate ### necessary ### brave ### mild } part of a life.

I was trying to make my way through the crowds when a guy in a black coat came up to me , told me that he had lost his brown leather { scarf ### purse ### wallet ### glove } and shoved his gray business card into my hand .
Please call me at the number on the card if you happen to find it, he said.I looked at him, shrugged my shoulders and { told ### said ### replied ### answered } , Yeah, no problem.I'll do that.
Suddenly, I noticed a flat, green box { lain ### hidden ### sleeping ### staying } under some wrapping paper .
I opened it up to find an amazing { glass ### silver ### wood ### china } plate with a Nativity scene on it .
There it was . I smiled { proudly ### heavily ### widely ### broadly } , gathered it up and headed glass the cash register .
There it was . I smiled hidden , gathered it up and headed { back ### into ### for ### down } the cash register .
As the cashier was ringing up my { cash ### purchase ### charge ### cost } , I reached into my pocket to get my money .
 { But ### And ### So ### For } my pocket was empty!
I began to scramble around searching every pocket when I { thought ### supposed ### realized ### confirmed } I had left my wallet at home.
So I did the only thing I could think of at that moment : I ran outside the store and started to beg people for { advice ### money ### coffee ### bread } .
Some looked at me like I was crazy ; others just { ignored ### refused ### missed ### hated } me .
Finally, giving up, I slumped down on a cold bench feeling totally { attracted ### confused ### frightened ### defeated } .
I reached down to tie my shoe when I spotted a { black ### blue ### brown ### green } wallet lying next to the front leg of the bench .
I wondered if it { could ### must ### may ### would } be the wallet that the man in the black coat had lost .
Then my mouth dropped in awe { after ### when ### before ### while } I discovered three hundred dollars inside .
I found a nearby pay phone and made a/an { urgent ### brief ### collect ### distant } call to the number on the gray business card .
Then he opened up the wallet and { paid ### handed ### shared ### showed } me four twenty-dollar bills, thanking me again and I hurried to get my mom a present before the mall closed .
I bought the glass plate and started skating home, { grateful ### helpful ### amazed ### delighted } that everything had worked out .
I realized that I had been sort of a Christmas angel for the man who had lost his wallet, and that he had been the same for me when I'd { forgotten ### missed ### found ### remembered } mine .
But it { lasted ### took ### spent ### wasted } a long time to believe such good things could happen to me .
When I was a youngster I stuttered so badly that I was completely { uncertain ### uncomfortable ### unbelievable ### unable } to speak in public .
 { However ### Besides ### Then ### Therefore } , when I was 14, Professor Donald Crouch came to our school .
English was his favorite subject and { novel ### Architecture ### art ### poetry } was his deepest love .
He held a book of poems as if it were a diamond necklace, { drawing ### Writing ### turning ### finding } pages as if uncovering treasures .
When he heard our school was teaching Shakespeare and other classics, he could no longer { protect ### help ### keep ### stand } not being a part of our school .
When he { learned ### recognized ### decided ### proved } that I not only loved poetry but was saving it, we became closer .
When he proved that I not only loved poetry but was { Writing ### reading ### reciting ### saving } it, we became closer .
There was, however, one { difference ### difficulty ### promise ### similarity } between us-Professor Crouch could not bear the saving that I refused to read my poems to the class .
There was, however, one proved between us-Professor Crouch could not bear the { truth ### idea ### fact ### belief } that I refused to read my poems to the class .
Jim, poetry is { said ### meant ### taught ### prepared } to be read aloud, he said.
I shook my head and turned away. One day he { fooled ### joked ### tricked ### scolded } me .
After handing in a poem, I waited for his { idea ### reward ### congratulation ### comment } .
Instead, one day as the students gathered together, he { told ### noticed ### attacked ### challenged } me, Jim, I don't think you wrote this poem .
I stared at him in { disbelief ### silence ### sadness ### excitement } .
Why, I started, anger { flowing ### flooding ### filling ### sweeping } me.
Well, then, he said, you've got to prove it by getting up and reciting it { with ### By ### from ### in } memory.
For a moment I stood there, { terrified ### hopeless ### disappointed ### breathless } .
Then I began, and kept going . I recited my poem all the way { down ### along ### through ### around } !
I discovered I did have a(n) { voice ### sound ### appearance ### interest } and found my fellow students actually looked forward to hearing me recite.
I decided to { remember ### congratulate ### memorize ### celebrate } by inviting a few friends out to supper.
I chose a restaurant in a { calm ### quiet ### busy ### faraway } part of town.
It is { hardly ### often ### hard ### always } ever crowded, because not many people know about it, so it is not usually necessary to book a table .
It is hardly ever crowded, because not many people know about it, so it is not usually { important ### possible ### necessary ### certain } to book a table .
When we entered the restaurant, we were surprised to find it completely { full ### empty ### free ### quiet } .
I looked around but no { person ### table ### waiter ### friend } was free.
It was like an invasion . { Happily ### Luckily ### Suddenly ### Hopefully } the place was full!
The people there are about to { start ### end ### leave ### pay } , he said.
Just hold on and you'll { find ### take ### wait ### see } a place there.
Fifteen minutes later, the people { by ### at ### beside ### near } the corner table paid their find , got up and left .
Fifteen minutes later, the people leave the corner table paid their { money ### drink ### food ### bill } , got up and left .
 { Luckily ### Normally ### Unluckily ### Angrily } , our table was almost out of sight.
We tried to call the attention of the waiter who sent us there, { but ### so ### yet ### and } he, like all the other waiters, was at with the party of tourists .
We tried to call the attention of the waiter who sent us there, find he, like all the other waiters, was { easy ### busy ### strict ### satisfied } with the party of tourists .
At last, an hour later, the tourists were finishing their meal and looking very { excited ### tired ### disappointed ### pleased } with life.
I advised my friends about the best dishes and finally the waiter went off with our { order ### foods ### dishes ### money } .
We could tell from his face that he had { good ### bad ### valuable ### pleasant } news for us.
 { Remaining ### Seeing ### Looking ### Finding } a little sorry he told us that there was no meat or fish.
All we can { find ### sell ### offer ### bring } you, he said, is an omelet !
You must also { think ### experience ### seem ### feel } as if your life is completely out of control at times .
It is during those down times that words of encouragement from family, friends, co-workers or { so ### just ### even ### ever } strangers can boost your spirits .
It is also during those { processes ### times ### courses ### practices } that destructive words can be devastating and sink you deeper and deeper into depression .
For example, consider this story about a group of { frogs ### mice ### dogs ### cats } who were traveling through the woods when two of them fell into a deep pit .
For example, consider this story about a group of frogs who were traveling through the woods when { two ### three ### many ### few } of them fell into a deep pit .
All of the other frogs gathered around the { hole ### pit ### water ### well } .
When they saw how { muddy ### wide ### deep ### long } the pit was, they told the two pit frogs they would never get out .
When they saw how two the pit was, they told the two { uncomfortable ### unpleasant ### unhappy ### unfortunate } frogs they would never get out .
The two frogs didn't obey what other frogs said and tried to { run ### walk ### climb ### jump } out of the pit .
The other frogs kept telling them not to jump, { so ### since ### because ### although } it was in vain .
He fell down and { died ### wounded ### destroyed ### damaged } .
The other frog continued to jump as { fast ### hard ### easily ### swiftly } as he could .
Once again the crowd of frogs shouted at him to { help ### ban ### stop ### forbid } the pain .
The more they { cried ### spoke ### shouted ### read } , the harder he jumped and finally he made it to safety .
The frog { explained ### announced ### introduced ### told } to them that he was a little bit deaf .
He thought they were { encouraging ### helping ### pulling ### dragging } him all the time .
For this reason, the navy { always ### seldom ### forever ### sometimes } has its police in big ports.
One day, the police in a big seaport received a telephone call { about ### from ### in ### of } a bar in the town.
 { Instead ### Therefore ### Although ### Then } , he chose the smallest and weakest-looking man he could find to go to the bar with him and seize the sailor .
 Instead , he chose the smallest and { good-looking ### weakest-looking ### ugly-looking ### strongest-looking } man he could find to go to the bar with him and seize the sailor .
Another officer who happened to be there was surprised when he saw the officer of the guard chose such a small man. { Yet ### But ### So ### Then } he said to him, Why weakest-looking you take a big man with you ?
Another officer who happened to be there was surprised when he saw the officer of the guard chose such a small man. Instead he said to him, Why { don't ### couldn't ### can't ### do } you take a big man with you ?
Yes, you are { all ### very ### too ### quite } right, answered the officer of the guard.
That is exactly { how ### what ### why ### that } I am taking this small man.
If you see two policemen coming { up ### at ### before ### towards } you, and one is much smaller than the other, which one don't you attack ?
If you see two policemen coming So you, and one is much smaller than the other, which one { could ### will ### do ### can } you attack ?
Her eyes were as blue as the sea, and she had { cars ### hairs ### teeth ### fingers } like an even row of pearls.
It is so { unfair ### lonely ### surprising ### touching } that some people have it all.
The next week I saw her again, and after that it became almost { strange ### boring ### stressful ### routine } o see her.
Slowly the pretty woman walked around to the passenger side-- { putting ### turning ### leaning ### carrying } on a walking cane.
She { skipped ### patted ### pressed ### lifted } one leg with her hands and then the other one; she had a prosthetic on her left leg and a brace on her right one.
He said he knew her husband and that, when the lady was 12 years old, she had been { limited ### left ### knocked ### trapped } in a car that got stuck on the railroad tracks.
The rail company made a large { arrangement ### fortune ### settlement ### contract } with her because the crossing had no signals ; that is why she owned such a nice car .
The rail company made a large settlement with her because the crossing had no { signals ### stations ### pedestrians ### announcement } ; that is why she owned such a nice car .
For weeks I had { ignored ### envied ### respected ### understood } this woman and her way of life.
Now I realize how lucky I am.When you meet a person who seems to be much better off than you don't be { prevented ### limited ### blocked ### fooled } appearances.
There is nothing more { technical ### important ### serious ### common } in education.
We turn out students from our universities who know how to give answers, but not how to { afford ### tell ### repeat ### ask } questions.

They are not taught the great { art ### theme ### idea ### style } of obedience(, ).

True reading is not just passing our art overwords on a page, or { gathering ### delivering ### sending ### passing } information, or even understanding what is being read .
True reading is a { native ### creative ### detective ### sensitive } act.
It means seeing first, and then using the { appreciation ### imagination ### presentation ### instruction } .

I meet people in all eyes of life, and most known in the fields of literature and science, who, though professionals, do not { generally ### obviously ### actually ### deliberately } read what is in front of them .
They only read what is { even ### forever. ### still ### already } known to them.
I suspect this is happening now, even as you read this { top ### page ### subject ### book } .
All our innovations , our discoveries, our { creativity ### possibility ### program ### project } come from one source: being able first to see what is there, and what is not; to hear what is said, and what is not; but also to think clearly.

My family are all musicians ,so I was { recognized ### interviewed ### found ### invited } when I went into our local music store .
I explained that I waned to sing again but using recurded knraoke music I knew that discs were very expensive and I really didn't have a lot of { money ### time ### energy ### knowledge } to get started ,And recognized you find only three to four songs out of ten on a disc that you can money use .

He placed his large hand { Unhappily ### lovingly ### pitifully ### gratefully } on his treasure and said .
You can take your { pick ### turn ### role ### step } and I ll record them for you .That should get you started.
His { courage ### devotion ### kindness ### rust } still warms my heart and makes me do just that bit extra , which I have the chance.

Green opened the big handbag she was { holding ### getting ### carrying ### bringing } and took out her sewing .
Without saying a word, she { took ### brought ### picked ### chose } a needle with a very small eye, and threaded it at her first attempt.

He was greatly troubled by the rough roads where gravel and broken stones pricked and numbed his { body ### arms ### feet ### legs } .
When he returned to his palace he issued an order that all the roads be { crowded ### filled ### covered ### put } with cattle hide .
He thought it was beneficial not only to { others ### himself ### them ### themselves } but also to his people and hoped covered would no longer be a painful thing But even if all the cattle in the kingdom were killed there himself not be enough hide to get the work done .

Evidently it was a stupid { comment ### chance ### attempt ### opinion } .
As it was an imperial order people could do nothing but shake their heads and { sigh ### sign ### cheer ### weep } .
At this juncture a clever servant in the palace { wanted ### ventured ### planned ### hoped } to make a suggestion.
You don't have to mobilize so many people, to have so many oxen killed, nor so much money { wasted ### borrowed ### saved ### loaned } .

To my { joy ### surprise ### dislike ### disappointment } , it was the same score.
Later that evening, I { tearfully ### fearfully ### cheerfully ### hopefully } told Frank what I had learned that day.
We decided that Michael's score must have been a { joke ### mistake ### warning ### wonder } and we should treat him naturally as usual .
We decided that Michael's score must have been a mistake and we should treat him { specially ### strictly ### naturally ### carefully } as usual .
We moved to Indiana in 1962, and Michael studied at Concordia High School in the same year, he got { poor ### good ### average ### standard } grades in the school, especially in biology and chemistry, which was a great comfort.
Michael { visited ### entered ### passed ### chose } Indiana University in 1965 as a pre-medical student.
Soon afterwards, his teacher permitted him to take more courses than { allowed ### described ### required ### offered } .
On graduation day in 1972, Frank and I { missed ### held ### delayed ### attended } the ceremony at Yale.
After the ceremony, we told Michael about the { high ### same ### low ### different } IQ score he got when he was six.
Since that day, Michael sometimes would look at us and say { curiously ### eagerly ### calmly ### jokingly } , My dear mom and dad never told me that I couldn't be a doctor, not until after I graduated from medical school!
It is his special way of thanking us for the { confidence ### interest ### pride ### delight } we had in him.
We went to the same clinic where he had { received ### accepted ### organized ### discussed } the test eighteen years before.
A result like that was supposed to be { imperfect ### impossible ### uncertain ### unsatisfactory } .
Children often do as well as what adults, particularly parents and teachers, { hear ### learn ### expect ### speak } of them.
That is, tell a child he is { wise ### rude ### shy ### stupid } , and he may play the role of a foolish child.
We all stood there { talking ### waiting ### complaining ### expecting } , some patiently , others annoyed because nature messed up their hurried day .
I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens { taking ### putting ### driving ### washing } away the dirt and dust of the world.
Mom, let's run through the rain, a girl's voice { caught ### broke ### impressed ### called } me.
No, honey. We'll wait until it { slows ### comes ### pushes ### calms } down a bit, Mom replied.
The young girl waited about another minute and { asked ### repeated ### required ### added } : Mom, let's run through the rain.
That's not what you said this morning, the young girl said as she { pulled ### touched ### waved ### felt } her Mom's arm.
This morning? { Why ### How ### When ### Where } did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?
The entire crowd turned { still ### silent ### serious ### angry } .
Mom paused and thought for a moment about { what ### how ### whether ### if } she would say.
Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being { dishonest ### silly ### daring ### forgetful } .
But then we heard, Honey, you are { right ### wrong ### stupid ### clever } .
If we get wet, maybe we just need washing, Mom said. Then { off ### along ### on ### over } they ran.
We all stood { sighing ### joking ### discussing ### watching } , smiling and laughing as they ran past the cars.
But they were { followed ### guided ### respected ### praised } by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars .

Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, and they can even take away your { house ### money ### health ### time } .

So, don't forget to make time and take the { possibilities ### risk ### opportunities ### challenge } to make memories every day!
They create41 { wonders ### imaginations ### memories ### interests } that will last a lifetime.
The kids were excited as we pulled the freshly43 { cut ### bought ### grown ### decorated } tree into the house.
We would turn on the Christmas songs44 { unless ### before ### while ### though } the tree decoration began.
Our hearts seemed to45 { whisper ### swing ### talk ### dance } to the merriment of the Christmas songs.
The kids' eyes twinkled with46 { amazement ### curiosity ### delight ### anxiety } .
Years later, when my daughter Darla was home from college, she47 { offered ### refused ### pretended ### hesitated } to help decorate the tree.
I was so48 { disappointed ### regretful ### puzzled ### grateful } .
It was a beautiful tree and its49 { lasting ### unique ### pleasant ### unusual } smell filled the room.
As we had every year before, I brought out the eggnog and the pfeffernusse cookies for our traditional50 { activity ### custom ### souvenir ### celebration } .
Then, during the laughter, Darla suddenly got very51 { annoyed ### depressed ### serious ### quiet } and said she had something to tell me.
From her hesitation and body52 { language ### shape ### image ### expression } , I learned that she was53 fearing it .
From her hesitation and body52 language , I learned that she was53 { expecting ### fearing ### resisting ### recalling } it .

Then very54 language and caringly, Darla looked me in the eye and said, Mom, I've55 { ever ### yet ### never ### just } liked pfeffernusse cookies .
She sat down next to me. Then I56 { explained ### realized ### admitted ### remembered } the importance of what she had just said.
All those childhood years, rather than57 { comfort ### hurt ### understand ### convey } Mom's feelings and spoil Mom's tradition, she had stood the cookies58 gently .
All those childhood years, rather than57 fearing Mom's feelings and spoil Mom's tradition, she had stood the cookies58 { silently ### roughly ### gradually ### unfairly } .
From a child's heart, year after year she had given me the gift of59 { patience ### desire ### love ### determination } !
My daughter taught me life's very important60 { knowledge ### inspiration ### technique ### lesson } : The best gifts aren't always found under the Christmas tree.

As a student, I was most { proud ### ready ### excited ### afraid } to answer questions in class, and I found that the students around were just like me.
At the beginning of each class, when the professor asked a question, I always { raised ### shook ### lowered ### nodded } my head, for fear that the professor saw me.
The speaker always wanted someone to be in communication with him, so he asked how many students in the classroom learned Economics, but no one { replied ### agreed ### reported ### admitted } .

Before the beginning of every lecture, I found a(n) { tense ### interesting ### attractive ### dull } phenomenon .

This had a great influence on me. The chance will not find you { themselves ### himself ### yourself ### itself } .
You must show yourself constantly to { pay ### draw ### focus ### fix } others' attention for you to find a chance on the cards.
Like most July days, it was hot.I stepped into a tiny ice-cream shop to cool off with a chocolate ice-cream.It was a very { expensive ### large ### splendid ### old-time } store with little round tables and chairs.
As I entered, I found a very old woman bent over a { window ### pillow ### table ### bench } near the door .

As I thought, another { aged ### dirty ### pretty ### poor } lady entered the shop and sat down with her .
In minutes, the two of them were shaking with { food ### fear ### cold ### laughter } .
I looked again at the first woman, then in the { newspaper ### window ### mirror ### picture } on a nearby wall, catching a picture of myself .
She was { just ### well ### poorly ### quickly } dressed in white, her face carefully made up and her hands mirror with gold rings .
She was laughter dressed in white, her face carefully made up and her hands { shining ### shaking ### waving ### wiping } with gold rings .

She had millions of { terrible ### difficult ### wonderful ### fresh } memories to recall .
She was old, but it wasn't { pleasing ### hurting ### envying ### punishing } her .
As I left the shop, I thought of my { good ### simple ### foolish ### interesting } question about God letting people live past their prime .
Why, that woman was more { alive ### changeable ### hopeful ### interesting } to life than I was .

A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a proposal, I read in a magazine about how we can { enrich ### strengthen ### lengthen ### deepen } our marriage.
Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit { annoying ### surprising ### satisfying ### inspiring } with the other.
Then, we can talk about how we can { fix ### do ### find ### set } them together and make our lives happier together.
The husband { smiled ### refused ### agreed ### hesitated } .
So each of them went to a(n) { spare ### separate ### empty ### special } room and thought about the things that annoyed them about the other for the rest of the day.
The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their { dishes ### magazines ### lives ### lists } .
After the wife had read all three pages to her husband, { disappointedly ### unluckily ### bitterly ### quietly } the husband seated, I don't have anything on my list.
I think that you are perfect the { appearance ### way ### situation ### position } that you are.
I don't want you to { change ### accept ### decide ### drop } anything for me.
The wife, touched by his honesty by his depth of his love for her and his { advice ### warning ### acceptance ### pride } of her, turned her head and wept.
We don't really have to go { leaving ### waiting ### asking ### looking } for them.
I never had a father, though in my neighborhood that's not { common ### normal ### real ### unusual } .
I know some kids just like me . You have to { comfort ### encourage ### watch ### tolerate } yourself .
There are fights and killings all the time.I have friends who ended up in jail or pregnant.1 could have ended up that way, too, but Mr. Clark and my mom { couldn't ### wouldn't ### shouldn't ### mustn't } let that happen.
In fact, I did so well that in sixth grade, I entered the { local ### general ### gifted ### scared } class, and Mr .
Clark was the teacher . I felt so { sudden ### lucky ### annoyed ### anxious } to have him for a second year !
Before the show, he { treated ### directed ### showed ### swapped } us to dinner at a restaurant and taught us not to talk with our mouths full .
We didn't want to let him { off ### out ### up ### down } , so we listened to him attentively .
 { Some ### Any ### None ### Many } of us were surprised when Mr .
When he learned he'd won, he said he would { give ### enter ### draw ### register } three names out of a hat ; he would go to Los Angeles to get the award with those students .
When he learned he'd won, he said he would draw three names out of a hat ; he would go to Los Angeles to get the { reward ### bonus ### diploma ### award } with those students .
But { after ### when ### before ### since } it came time to draw names, Mr .
He got { donations ### suggestions ### requests ### messages } to fly all 37 of us out to Disneyland in California and put us up at the Hilton .
People were { excited ### satisfied ### ashamed ### amazed } , but Mr .
There's no way I can { suggest ### advocate ### imagine ### complain } most teachers doing that .
We didn't want his class to { end ### start ### continue ### last } .
Clark showed up . He's been a { colleague ### sponsor ### success ### constant } in our lives .
Clark took some of us on a trip to South Africa to { deliver ### collect ### display ### recommend } school supplies and visit orphanages .
It was the most amazing { adventure ### experience ### vacation ### interview } of my life .
It's now my { dream ### conclusion ### turn ### demand } to one day start a group of women's clubs, helping people from all backgrounds .
While the other coats drooped , this one looked as if it were { turning ### holding ### showing ### hanging } itself up.
The coat was beautifully made, with a Fifth Avenue label and an { unreasonable ### unbearable ### unbelievable ### unfair } price of $28, which was popular just then with teenagers , but could cost several hundred dollars new .
The coat was beautifully made, with a Fifth Avenue label and an unbelievable price of $28, which was popular just then with { teenagers ### adults ### women ### men } , but could cost several hundred dollars new .
John tried it on and the { color ### price ### style ### fit } was perfect.
John { sent ### carried ### brought ### wore } the coat to school the next day and came home with a big smile.
They loved it, he said, { casually ### comfortably ### carefully ### quickly } folding it over the back of a chair and smoothing it flat.
Over the next few weeks, a { happiness ### change ### smile ### matter } came over John.
Agreement replaced contrariness and { reasoned ### heated ### wild ### strong } discussion replaced fierce argument.
He became more mannerly and { considerate ### handsome ### hopeful ### curious } , eager to please.
He would generously lend his younger brother his tapes and lecture him { of ### on ### in ### at } his behavior.
When I mentioned this { incident ### accident ### affair ### event } to his teacher and wondered what caused the changes, she said laughing.
It { can ### must ### will ### should } be his coat!
Another teacher told him she was giving him a good mark not only because he had earned { this ### them ### it ### one } but because she liked his coat.
At the library, we ran { down ### with ### into ### after } a friend.
John and I both know we should never { change ### mistake ### trade ### turn } a person's clothes for the real person within them.
 { However ### Moreover ### Therefore ### Besides } , there is something to be said for wearing a standard of excellence for the world to see and for mistake what is on the inside with what is on the outside .
 into , there is something to be said for wearing a standard of excellence for the world to see and for { attaching ### joining ### relating ### matching } what is on the inside with what is on the outside .
For John, it is a time when it is as easy to try on different { mean ### methods ### approaches ### measures } to life as it is to try on a coat.
The whole world, the whole future is stretched out ahead, a vast landscape { where ### why ### how ### when } all the doors are open.
It was very rushed. It was the very last minute and I was { unlucky ### uncomfortable ### unhappy ### unprepared } .
So without the { support ### suggestion ### idea ### advice } of my family, I got up in front of a group of people and got ready to present my poem .
So without the support of my family, I got up in front of a group of people and got ready to { give ### begin ### write ### present } my poem .
Yet I really wanted to do it. But I didn't expect to { fail ### win ### cry ### lose } .
Judges were chosen from the audience by { making ### dropping ### having ### leaving } a bouncy ball thrown out into their midst to see win would catch it .
Judges were chosen from the audience by present a bouncy ball thrown out into their midst to see { whom ### who ### that ### whoever } would catch it .
As it is with most { competitions ### games ### meetings ### events } , performers had 2 minutes to impress the win who would then give a score from 0 .
As it is with most present , performers had 2 minutes to impress the { readers ### listeners ### audiences ### judges } who would then give a score from 0 .
0 to 10 . There were five judges. I was the { youngest ### oldest ### tallest ### strongest } person in the competition.
I'm only 16 and everybody else was about 20-70. My poem { became ### went ### read ### sounded } really well.
In the end I { chose ### wanted ### came ### had } third, but I was not disappointed.
After all , it was only 0.3 points that separated me { of ### from ### over ### with } second place.
 { While ### When ### Before ### Until } it was all over, I was waiting in the car park for my dad to pick me up.
Even though many people had congratulated me, this was { different ### wonderful ### surprised ### reasonable } .
She said, Here, have the { prize ### poem ### experience ### ball } , so you remember tonight .
I { pushed ### carried ### looked ### pulled } a smile card out for the woman thanking her for her words and the ball.
It was a { good ### silent ### happy ### simple } understanding.
My father beeped from the car park so I { nodded ### showed ### said ### expressed } my goodbye and got in the car, holding in my hand the bouncy ball that changed me.
As we get older we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that { design ### promote ### direct ### shape } us and make us who we are.
It is the same with the challenges that come with { confidence ### pressure ### friendship ### difficulty } .
When we are faced with a challenge, we usually have two { opportunities ### expectations ### choices ### aspects } .
We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing { demanding ### deserving ### predicting ### presenting } the challenge isn't worth the trouble and call it quits .
We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing presenting the challenge isn't worth the { comment ### loss ### trouble ### expense } and call it quits .
Although there are certainly { spans ### times ### dates ### ages } when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most trouble all that is needed is times and communication .
Although there are certainly presenting when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most { cases ### fields ### parts ### occasions } all that is needed is times and communication .
Although there are certainly presenting when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most trouble all that is needed is { assessment ### commitment ### encouragement ### adjustment } and communication .
When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how { doubtful ### shameful ### harmful ### painful } or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to trouble it and work it through instead of running away from it .
When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how presenting or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to { keep ### control ### face ### catch } it and work it through instead of running away from it .
Communication is making a { space ### plan ### topic ### room } for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong.
 { If ### As ### While ### Unless } you can say to a friend, I got my feeling hurt, rather than You hurt my feelings, you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster.
In dealing with the many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for { what ### who ### where ### which } they are: small hurdles you need to jump or get through on your way through life.
Nothing is so big that it is { unnecessary ### necessary ### impossible ### possible } to get over, and hurt only commitment to make us stronger .
Nothing is so big that it is cases to get over, and hurt only { serves ### means ### aims ### attempts } to make us stronger .
It is all part of growing up, it { opens ### appeals ### goes ### happens } to everyone, and some day you will look back on all of this and say, Hard as it was, it made me who I am today.
She { stopped ### ordered ### encouraged ### agreed } all her pupils to have one, and sometimes arranged for their parents to come and see the work they had done as a result .
She encouraged all her pupils to have one, and sometimes { arranged ### asked ### looked ### waited } for their parents to come and see the work they had done as a result .
One Friday { afternoon ### evening ### night ### morning } the teacher told the class that those who had a hobby could have a arranged that afternoon to get the things they had made as parts of their hobbies ready for their morning to see the following afternoon .

One Friday encouraged the teacher told the class that those who had a hobby could have a arranged that afternoon to get the things they had made as parts of their hobbies ready for their { teachers ### parents ### friends ### classmates } to see the following afternoon .
So in the afternoon, while those of the pupils who had nothing to { present ### do ### see ### eat } did their usual lessons, the lucky ones who had made something were allowed to go home, on condition that they returned before five o'clock to bring what they were going to show and to arrange it.
When the afternoon lesson began, the teacher was { sad ### happy ### frightened ### surprised } to see Tommy was not there.
He was the laziest boy in the class, and the teacher found it { difficult ### easy ### reliable ### disable } to believe he had a hobby.
However, at 4:45, Tommy arrived with a(n) { ugly ### small ### beautiful ### obvious } collection of butterflies in glass cases.
After his { classmates ### brother ### father ### teacher } had admired them and helped him to arrange them on a table in the classroom, she was surprised to see Tommy present them up again and begin to leave .
After his parents had admired them and helped him to arrange them on a table in the classroom, she was surprised to see Tommy { throw ### pick ### switch ### use } them up again and begin to leave .
Those things must { remain ### leave ### observe ### undertake } here until tomorrow afternoon.
I know { them ### him ### that ### this } , answered Tommy, and I will bring them back tomorrow ; but my surprised doesn't want them to be out of our house at night in case they are difficult .
I know present , answered Tommy, and I will bring them back tomorrow ; but my { sister ### friend ### brother ### mother } doesn't want them to be out of our house at night in case they are difficult .
I know present , answered Tommy, and I will bring them back tomorrow ; but my surprised doesn't want them to be out of our house at night in case they are { stolen ### shown ### completed ### matched } .
But Tommy, you are { fired ### supposed ### related ### ignored } to show your own hobby here, not somebody else's!
I know that, answered Tommy. My hobby is { helping ### concerning ### watching ### Seeking } my brother collecting butterflies.
They had been high school sweethearts. And they { happened ### appeared ### looked ### had } to have a happy marriage.
They owned their home and { one ### no ### three ### two } kids, two cars, and a family dog.
 { Luckily ### As ### Thanks ### But } to Mike, after seven years of marriage, something was terribly wrong.
The Murrays had reached their material goals and Mike { surprised ### understood ### wondered ### asked } , Now what?
It was so { difficult ### comfortable ### apply ### easy } for her to turn her focus from Mike to 6-month-old Eric and 2-year-old Brittany.
They no longer really communicated---yes, they answered { simple ### surface ### scientific ### social } questions, but they didn't talk heart to heart as they had in the early years of their marriage.
Mike felt trapped. I { really ### likely ### always ### never } had time to do things that I wanted to, he said.
Mike can still remember the { look ### face ### feeling ### want } of hurt and total surprise on Mary's face.
She was troubled, and he knew that he had turned against his best friend { since ### from ### to ### of } high school.
The expression on her face jarred him into reality , and he began to understand the { good ### wrong ### harm ### harmful } he was doing to his family.
I really mean that - I almost knocked her { off ### about ### over ### out } .
As I began to { scold ### shout ### run ### apologize } , she started yelling at me.
But soon I realized that she was, in fact , saying hello and welcoming me to her class in a very { scary ### weak ### loud ### soft } voice.
Kirsch, as she wanted us to call her, had a { traditional ### quiet ### creative ### rude } and fascinating character.
When we read the play Macbeth by Shakespeare, Kirsch let us play { instruments ### games ### characters ### tricks } and wear masks.
Every time we read the word thunder in the text, she would hit { quickly ### heavily ### hardly ### gently } on the drum, making a loud noise!
My classmates and I would { cry ### read ### speak ### laugh } loudly.
During group discussions, Kirsch often told us to sit in a { line ### circle ### chair ### corner } on the floor.
We talked about the { film ### book ### novel ### play } while she just sat in a corner and took notes of what we said.
Doing so made us feel independent and { treat ### devote ### improve ### learn } ourselves more with critical thinking.
It is the strangest { despite ### yet ### so ### or } the most entertaining class I have ever had.
She smiles, laughs and tells jokes { whenever ### whatever ### wherever ### whichever } she goes.
But I found out about another { side ### story ### identity ### purpose } of her the other day.
After school that day, I was walking by my English classroom { when ### while ### as ### after } I saw Ms. Kirschmann with her son.
She was trying to { advise ### persuade ### force ### talk } him to put on his jacket in a low voice.
She spoke in such a gentle manner that I was quite { excited ### disappointed ### delighted ### amazed } .
Until then, it never { thought ### happened ### occurred ### hit } to me that Ms. Kirschmann could be quiet.
I had thought she was { both ### just ### less ### also } energetic, calm, intelligent and caring all at once.
Suddenly I { worried ### thought ### talked ### learned } about my dad a lot.
My dad is { hardly ### basically ### absolutely ### finally } the kindest man in the world.
He would never { refuse ### receive ### abandon ### abuse } anyone in trouble.
Although this happened many times, I { saw ### remind ### forget ### remember } one incident on one of those trips to Shreveport.
That time on the { field ### street ### side ### way } , my dad saw a hitchhiker ( ).
Dad asked me to pull the car over and offer him a { gift ### lift ### chance ### sign } .
At first the hitchhiker was hesitant ( ), but he changed his { attitude ### trip ### route ### road } as he could tell we were really listening to him.
I did know that it was quite { dark ### sunny ### cold ### windy } outside and the hitchhiker was very happy to be able to get a lift in our warm car.
We { walked ### escaped ### drove ### flew } another forty-five minutes and learned that the hitchhiker was confronting many difficulties in life .
We drove another forty-five minutes and learned that the hitchhiker was { confronting ### finding ### deciding ### causing } many difficulties in life .
Dad told him to keep his head up and said that { something ### anything ### nothing ### everything } would become better for him soon.
He { turned ### reached ### looked ### got } into his pocket and handed the hitchhiker a twenty-dollar bill, leaving only a ten-dollar bill for himself.
The hitchhiker then became very { angry ### nervous ### sad ### grateful } .
Dad always gave them money { and ### if ### though ### unless } he did not have much of his own.
From that I've learned a lot about my dad and { life ### business ### adventure ### entertainment } .
I've learned that if you come from a place with { laughter ### success ### complaint ### love } , you will show a lot of kindness to people who are life .
I've learned that if you come from a place with though , you will show a lot of kindness to people who are { suffering ### travelling ### playing ### studying } .
Just one single kind act may { enjoy ### change ### risk ### share } someone's life.
I was 28 at the time and my son had just been { admitted ### introduced ### led ### pushed } into elementary school, and was sitting on a park bench with me, telling me all about his friends and teachers in the new school.
He was extremely { nervous ### upset ### excited ### shy } , I could tell.
Looking up into the cloudy blue sky while I { drove ### listened ### waited ### talked } , I was having a hard time thinking of questions to ask him about his new school , probably because he was answering every single one of them before I even asked them .
Looking up into the cloudy blue sky while I listened , I was having a hard time thinking of questions to ask him about his new { plan ### hobby ### occupation ### school } , probably because he was answering every single one of them before I even asked them .
Looking up into the cloudy blue sky while I listened , I was having a hard time thinking of questions to ask him about his new school , probably because he was answering every single one of them before I even { accepted ### exchanged ### asked ### revised } them .
Being in America, there were people of many different races and { abilities ### ages ### diplomas ### nationalities } that lived here, school I decided to ask him about those people .
Being in America, there were people of many different races and listened that lived here, { so ### but ### for ### or } I decided to ask him about those people .
He loved { physics ### geography ### history ### biology } , and if he heard someone who had a different school or something like that, he would ask them where they were from .
He loved listened , and if he heard someone who had a different { accent ### position ### aim ### interest } or something like that, he would ask them where they were from .
It was { amusing ### puzzling ### embarrassing ### amazing } for me.
I thought he was being rude and didn't { afford ### share ### create ### realize } it.
But the people would always { promise ### smile ### pass ### suggest } and tell him where, whether it was the UK, China, you name it.
 { Therefore ### Afterwards ### Instead ### Meanwhile } , he would get into his seat in my car and demand that I take him to the so so that he could learn about those places .
 nationalities , he would get into his seat in my car and demand that I take him to the { library ### stadium ### classroom ### laboratory } so that he could learn about those places .
I would { always ### seldom ### hardly ### ever } do it, giving him every bit of so he craved .
I would nationalities do it, giving him every bit of { power ### technology ### knowledge ### peace } he craved .
He was familiar with the word foreigner , even though he had no idea what it { proved ### instructed ### meant ### expected } .
I signed and spoke, So, David, are there any { volunteers ### headmaster ### tourists ### foreigners } at your school?
He looked at me { of ### by ### at ### with } the biggest smile I had ever seen, swing his legs back and force on the bench.
She said she wanted to work on a(n) { article ### experiment ### research ### study } on me.
When she had finished { studying ### interviewing ### calling ### praising } me for the article, she asked, What are you planning to do next?
Well, at that { day ### university ### time ### century } , there was actually nothing I was planning on doing next, and what came out for us was, I'm thinking about breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for Fastest-Talking Female .
Well, at that time , there was actually nothing I was planning on doing next, and what { provided ### gave ### took ### came } out for us was, I'm thinking about breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for Fastest-Talking Female .
Well, at that time , there was actually nothing I was planning on doing next, and what came out for us was, I'm thinking about { setting ### breaking ### playing ### holding } the Guinness Book of World Records for Fastest-Talking Female .
The newspaper article came out the next day, and the writer had { set ### made ### spoke ### included } my final remarks about trying to break the World's Fastest-Talking Female record.
At about 5 : 00 that afternoon, I got a { time ### chance ### call ### notice } from Larry King, asking me to go on the breaking .
At about 5 : 00 that afternoon, I got a came from Larry King, asking me to go on the { show ### stage ### movie ### book } .
They would { bring ### pick ### call ### drive } me up at 8:00 -- because they wanted me to do it that night!
I stared at the phone for a while, and then I called Guinness to find out { what ### whether ### when ### how } to break a fast-talking record.
They told me I would have to recite something. I began { practicing ### singing ### learning ### reading } .
I was both { horrible ### tired ### nervous ### happy } and excited at the same time.
I practised the whole way there, and by the time I reached the { studio ### theatre ### lab ### office } .
I asked the woman in charge, What { unless ### if ### though ### how } I don't break the record?
Larry doesn't { wonder ### consider ### care ### know } if you break it or not, she said.
So I asked myself, What's the { best ### most ### least ### worst } that can happen?
I'll look like a fool on television! A { small ### nice ### terrible ### big } thing, I told myself, studio I could live through that .
I'll look like a fool on television! A nervous thing, I told myself, { reading ### carrying ### thinking ### going } I could live through that .
I broke the record, becoming the World's Fastest-Talking Female { in ### on ### with ### by } speaking 585 words in one minute!
One day it began to rain and the rain { made ### kept ### drove ### sent } the tent wet.
As he passed a beautiful house he { forgot ### stopped ### managed ### asked } to look for rest.
A lady { was ### wore ### put ### dressed } in silk walked past him with her nose in the air .
A lady dressed in silk walked past him with her nose in the { wind ### room ### sky ### air } .
They stopped and glared at him. { How ### What ### Who ### Where } are you?
We don't like tramps going { from ### over ### in ### around } our home, one of them shouted.
Go away at once! { answered ### spoke ### cried ### replied } the other.
But I'm no tramp, said the man, { Which ### What ### Both ### All } I want is food and stay for the night.
Go away at once, the lady repeated. We don't like your { model ### kind ### men ### feet } around our house.
Go, go! The man moved on and { arrived ### got ### reached ### stopped } a small house.
Though the light was dim and the furniture was poor, { it ### they ### he ### she } had a warm, friendly atmosphere(,).
Can I have { any ### some ### much ### good } food and rest for the night?
Of course, friend, said the woman, { handing ### pulling ### pushing ### bringing } forward a little stool for him.
We're going to { prepare ### buy ### finish ### have } our supper.
Come and { help ### join ### move ### see } us.
The food was scarce(,) but they { added ### gave ### divided ### shared } it with the stranger.
That night they let him sleep on their bed { while ### because ### when ### after } they themselves used the stable .
Early the next morning, the man said good-bye to them. Their { friendship ### kindness ### spirit ### poorness } made a good impression in his while .
Early the next morning, the man said good-bye to them. Their shared made a good impression in his { look ### memory ### heart ### head } .
When he arrived home he quickly ordered a lovely house to be { moved ### sent ### built ### found } for the couple in the woods.
The large classroom was full of books and toys, the two things I { liked ### bought ### brought ### chose } .
But it was also full of kids all { younger ### smarter ### older ### taller } than me.
I think that my mom realized I was a little { allergic ### afraid ### confident ### shy } .
That was why she was always there to { pick ### bring ### ring ### take } me up right after school when I could have easily taken the school bus like my classmates did .
That was why she was always there to pick me up right after school when I could have { nervously ### easily ### hurriedly ### calmly } taken the school bus like my classmates did .
I would get on and take the front seat next to her and tell her all about my { idea ### plan ### wish ### day } .
Sometimes we would even read a book and wait { when ### until ### though ### because } all the cars and buses had left before we day home .
Sometimes we would even read a book and wait easily all the cars and buses had left before we { drove ### rode ### walked ### ran } home .
I cherished those { difficult ### endless ### special ### sad } times when I had my mom all to myself.
I felt so { upset ### safe ### quiet ### cool } and peaceful when we sat in the car together.
Beginning the new challenge of { adventure ### independence ### school ### work } didn't seem so difficult when I knew that I could drove my happiness and sadness with her .
Beginning the new challenge of until didn't seem so difficult when I knew that I could { share ### handle ### remove ### provide } my happiness and sadness with her .
Being a tiny, little kid in a scary world wasn't so { nice ### attractive ### exciting ### frightening } either.
I knew that my mom loved me and that was all I { tend ### used ### agreed ### gained } to be loving, joyful and strong.
As I look back on those happy times, now I can see that they also { prepared ### rewarded ### helped ### forgave } me for another special relationship I would find later in life.
All those times I spent { replying ### referring ### attending ### talking } to and being with my mother helped me school my heart to the world .
All those times I spent safe to and being with my mother helped me { warm ### open ### hurt ### order } my heart to the world .
Her beautiful love helped me { decide ### promise ### succeed ### learn } to love.

Keith,seventeen,from Montclair New Jersey,learned the hard way about one { letter ### notice ### message ### news } the eyes can make .
I had a { student ### headmaster ### friend ### teacher } who graded heavily on classroom discussion, Keith says.
He seemed to have a strong ability to know just when I didn't have the { question ### problem ### excuse ### answer } .

Many people,including some policemen,believe eye contact is a good { lesson ### way ### chance ### test } of honesty.
If someone can't look at you directly in the eye,then he or she is not playing { honestly ### quickly ### correctly ### really } ,they insist.
After many experiments, { therefore ### however ### actually ### especially } ,a number of experts have found out that good liars can make false eye contact.

In fact American children of { all ### some ### little ### old } ages would much rather play in sneakers than anything else, except perhaps no shoes at all.
Thousands of children sent in their { photos ### compositions ### poems ### drawings } and praised the sneakers they love.
One prize winner called { her ### his ### its ### their } poem The Sneaker and the World Peace .
When everyone is wearing sneakers, she said, it will be impossible to { explain ### guide ### hate ### love } .
Sneakers are { forever ### always ### seldom ### sometimes } washed.

Many decision makers have a(n) { ability ### tendency ### quality ### strength } to seek more information than required to make a good decision.
When too much information is sought and obtained, one or more of several { advantages ### agreements ### decisions ### problems } can arise.
* A { delay ### possibility ### solution ### settlement } * Information overload will occur .
* A delay * { Labor ### Knowledge ### Information ### Intelligence } overload will occur .
In this state, so much information is available that decision-making ability actually { eliminates ### declines ### qualifies ### promotes } because the information in its entirety can no longer be managed or assessed Information .
In this state, so much information is available that decision-making ability actually delay because the information in its entirety can no longer be managed or assessed { relatively ### objectively ### appropriately ### personally } .
A major problem caused by information overload is { forgetfulness ### inconvenience ### uselessness ### disability } .
* { Beauty ### Memory ### Sight ### Decision } fatigue occurs, where the decision maker tires of making decisions.
Unless information is { accidentally ### consciously ### occasionally ### independently } selected, processing will be biased toward the first part of the information received.
After that, the mind tires and begins to { ignore ### select ### store ### process } subsequent information or forget earlier information.
A common { interest ### sense ### conclusion ### misunderstanding } about decision making is that decisions are made in isolation from each other: you gather information, explore alternatives, and made a choice , without regard to anything that has gone before.
We might say, then every decision { prevents ### decides ### infers ### follows } from previous decisions: enables many future decisions, and assists other future decisions.
Little anxiety actually helps one { concentrate ### relax ### succeed ### experience } and work hard for the exams.
However, if students spend all their time in feeling { curious ### confident ### anxious ### calm } , a lot of valuable study time would be lost.
In this competitive world, { plans ### breaks ### jobs ### exams } cause a lot of nervousness in students.
For some, exam anxiety encourages them to work hard, while for others it may be the root cause for poor performance, leading to academic { failure ### achievement ### preparation ### performance } and lack of confidence.
In fact, some students are anxious by nature and easily get nervous when they face a(n) { peaceful ### stressful ### natural ### avoidable } situation.
They will think { positively ### confidently ### intentionally ### negatively } even if they have prepared well.
They fear that they may { remember ### forget ### confuse ### lose } what they have studied, and when it is too much, their fear is likely to come true .
They fear that they may forget what they have studied, and when it is too much, their { fear ### dream ### expectation ### competition } is likely to come true .
One of the most important methods of { increasing ### feeling ### avoiding ### creating } exam anxiety is to prepare well in advance.
Studying regularly for a few hours every day helps increase the { relaxation ### pressure ### nervousness ### confidence } of students.
 { Teachers ### Parents ### Friends ### Instructors } should also avoid giving pressure to their kids to do well.
Creating a peaceful and { relaxing ### exciting ### depressing ### worrying } atmosphere at home can be greatly helpful.
To { learn ### play ### rest ### eat } and sleep properly is also important.
Students tend to avoid sleep and starve themselves due to anxiety, but it is { helpful ### harmful ### important ### nice } to their academic performance and health.
They should always remember to set aside some time for their { studies ### habits ### hobbies ### meals } since some entertainment helps them relax and concentrate.

He was carrying it just { as ### for ### like ### just } a momma puppy, she told the station, and laid it at my feet.
The house keeper stressed that the body had no markings or signs of trauma , and that Luke { would ### must ### should ### need } never have hurt anyone.
I believe Luke found it, picked it { down ### out ### in ### up } and brought it.
We don't know { why ### where ### when ### how } the baby came from, Police Captain Dexter Nelson told KFOR.
Medical experts are trying to determine if the baby was born alive or { obvious ### religious ### dead ### raw } .
According to KOCO, Luke typically wandered over a large area, which officials are now seeking { for ### of ### from ### away } original place about the dead baby.

The director did the last { farewell ### job ### interview ### try } .
The director asked, Who paid for your school fees? John answered, My { tutors ### father ### parents ### mother } did.
When I was young, my father died . Then he continued, { What ### How ### Who ### Where } was your mother?
John answered, My mother worked as a { carpet ### floor ### clothes ### window } cleaner.
Hearing this, the director asked John to { turn ### show ### wave ### shake } his hands.
John reached out his hands that were { clumsy ### dirty ### strong ### smooth } and perfect.
The director said, I have a { request ### question ### wish ### choice } .
John felt { embarrassed ### frightened ### confused ### inspired } but did it.
His tears fell { before ### as ### since ### until } he cleaned his mother's hands.
He noticed for the first time that her hands were so { slim ### warm ### soft ### rough } .
Also John { realized ### believed ### insisted ### wondered } that it was this pair of hands that washed clothes every day to support him .
Also John realized that it was this pair of hands that washed clothes every day to { sacrifice(;) ### serve ### satisfy ### support } him .

Tears in eyes, John was asked to { improve ### describe ### awaken ### hide } his feelings.
Now I know what is { appreciation ### cooperation ### qualification ### communication } .
Without my mother, there wouldn't be the { wealthy ### famous ### successful ### humorous } me today .
By helping my mother, I see how { firm ### exciting ### crazy ### tough } it is to get something done.
I want a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others and a person who { shan't ### needn't ### won't ### can't } put money as his only goal in life.
In the meantime, occasionally, I { imagined ### noticed ### stopped ### heard } a young man struggling to get his drink.
He was spilling everything and making a { mess ### bet ### noise ### difference } .
As I got close, I noticed he was blind. I went over and { promised ### agreed ### offered ### waited } to help.
I took him by the hand and { sent ### caught ### showed ### led } him to the table.
I asked him if he { bought ### ordered ### lost ### needed } anything else and he said he was fine, so I left.
About two hours { long ### before ### later ### ago } I was heading to my car and the rain started pouring down.
I took { shelter ### risks ### chances ### rests } in a nearby building, and then I saw the young blind man again.
He was trying to cross the street and using his stick to make sure that { something ### nothing ### everything ### anything } was in his way.
He smiled and said, Hey! You are the young lady who helped me at the { hotel ### restaurant ### building ### shop } .
 { Then ### Suddenly ### Anyhow ### Anxiously } I took him by the hand and led him across the street.
I asked him { whether ### why ### when ### how } he knew I was the same person from the restaurant.
He said he { appreciated ### liked ### remembered ### forgot } my energy!
We { did ### tried ### made ### put } it to the other side of the street and he told me he was safe now and could make the rest of the way on his own .
We made it to the other side of the street and he told me he was { happy ### tired ### full ### safe } now and could make the rest of the way on his own .
So we said good-bye and went our separate { directions ### ways ### roads ### paths } .
As I got into my car I was all wet { and ### but ### so ### while } I felt warm.
I was glad I was able to be in both places to { help ### pick ### drag ### drive } that young man out even if it was very but .
I was glad I was able to be in both places to ways that young man out even if it was very { comfortable ### convenient ### simple ### difficult } .

So ways he is today, I hope he knows what a { surprise ### shock ### wonder ### pleasure } it was for me to have those two moments with him .
I didn't think there would be any difficulty in getting it { sold ### returned ### cleaned ### repaired } , as there are a whole lot of antique shops near my home.
 { And ### Yet ### Still ### So } I left home one morning carrying the chair with me.
I went into the first { club ### shop ### restaurant ### station } expecting a friendly reception.
I was quite { confident ### polite ### careless ### wrong } .
The second shop, though slightly more { eager ### different ### polite ### strange } , was just the same, and the third and the fourth, so I decided that my approach must be wrong .
The second shop, though slightly more polite , was just the same, and the third and the fourth, so I decided that my { approach ### appearance ### decision ### manners } must be wrong .
I entered the fifth shop with a(n) { question ### plan ### belief ### excuse } in my mind.
I placed the chair on the floor and said to the shopkeeper, Would you like to { check ### buy ### repair ### see } a chair?
He looked it over { carefully ### hurriedly ### unhappily ### excitedly } and said, Yes, not a bad chair.
It's got a slightly broken leg, I said. Yes, I saw that, it's { nothing ### everything ### anything ### something } .
Everything was going according to plan and I was getting { worried ### patient ### confused ### excited } .
Oh, it will be easy to sell { since ### once ### unless ### while } the repair is done.
I'll buy it, I said. What do you mean? You've just { lent ### sent ### sold ### returned } it to me, he said.
Yes, I know but I've { spoken ### changed ### settled ### lost } my mind.
I'll give you 27 pounds for it. You must be { anxious ### disappointed ### sick ### crazy } , he said.
Then, { constantly ### eventually ### suddenly ### naturally } the penny dropped.
You want me to repair your chair. You're { lucky ### wrong ### right ### wise } , I said.
I wouldn't have { expected ### agreed ### managed ### refused } to do it, he said.
We don't do repairs, not enough money in it and too much { loss ### damage ### trouble ### pressure } .
He was a very nice man and was greatly { amused ### disturbed ### inspired ### warne } by the whole thing.
The first day at school has left a deep { memory ### impression ### imagination ### feeling } on me.I'll never forget it.
As soon as I rushed into the classroom,the bell rang.A young beautiful woman came in,but she was { modern ### humorous ### gentle ### serious } ,no smile on her face.
You are not permitted to { trouble ### question ### interrupt ### excuse } me in the course of class unless .
. . She was speaking when I heard a { voice ### sound ### noise ### word } Lily,Lily from outside the door .
I didn't realize I was bare feet { before ### after ### just ### until } then .
I wanted to { get ### throw ### accept ### wear } them .
but I dared not do that . I shook my hand, { saying ### meaning ### crying ### shouting } Don't wait here any longer .
Leave quickly . As I did so,I still { fixed ### laid ### opened ### shut } my eyes on my teacher .
I really didn't want her to take { care ### interest ### attention ### notice } of me,but she did .
When she gave them to me,she looked at me for a while . My face suddenly turned { pale ### white ### red ### black } and my heart beat faster .
When she gave them to me,she looked at me for a while . My face suddenly turned red and my heart { beat ### jumped ### struck ### felt } faster .
Unfortunately I was so nervous that my { small ### dirty ### shaking ### own } hands couldn't get them onto my feet easily .
I rose from my seat quickly . Can you { add ### count ### recognize ### write } the numbers from one to one hundred?
To her surprise,I did very well.Finally she said, Be { careful ### sitting ### quiet ### seated } , please.Study hard.
I looked up at her to find a smile on her face.I felt { sorry ### relaxed ### disappointed ### puzzled } at last.
The first day at school has stayed in my { body ### classroom ### memory ### heart } as something embarrassing but relaxed .
The first day at school has stayed in my seated as something embarrassing but { strange ### sweet ### bad ### terrible } .
I went online to check if my pay was in my bank { account ### card ### balance ### draft } .
To my amazement I discovered that not only had I been paid, a { plant ### farm ### factory ### company } I'd never worked for had also paid me!
I knew I'd have been beside myself if my own salary was not in my account, so I tried to get the money { away ### out ### back ### from } to the right person.
Easier said than { supposed ### done ### imagined ### guessed } .
The bank couldn't help as it wasn't a bank { problem ### trouble ### matter ### business } .
The human resources department at the company that paid me was unable to help as I didn't have enough { details ### instructions ### facts ### arguments } .
 { Thankfully ### Hopefully ### Considerately ### Pitifully } , I had a sympathetic call operator who gave me a(n) name , so I again rang the company Daniel worked for.
I expected the bank would { approach ### demand ### send ### contact } me to arrange to take the money from my account and repay Daniel.
I heard { anything ### everything ### nothing ### something } for a month and the money remained in my account when Daniel called, explaining he'd tried to get back his money but had been unsuccessful as neither the bank nor his company felt it was their error .

He had rung to ask if I could speak to the bank, but after chatting for a few minutes we realized we could probably { analyze ### abandon ### raise ### fix } this problem ourselves.
We decided I would take the money from my account and he would { took ### made ### gave ### pick } it up from me.
Due to my busy job I was unable to meet Daniel { accidentally ### personally ### unfortunately ### purposely } but he left me a lovely bottle of wine in exchange for what was rightfully his.
I never had any { ideal ### hope ### aim ### intention } of keeping Daniel's pay but red tape made pick difficult to do the right thing .
I never had any fix of keeping Daniel's pay but red tape made { me ### one ### it ### that } difficult to do the right thing .

You support someone when you help him or her through a { different ### cheerful ### challenging ### definite } time.
 { Therefore ### However ### Moreover ### Meanwhile } , the best part is that when you support others, you are also supporting yourselves.
When you { encourage ### refuse ### begin ### decide } to give support to others, it is usually a sign that you are also stopping giving support to yourself .
When you refuse to give support to others, it is usually a { sign ### signal ### mark ### sight } that you are also stopping giving support to yourself .
One of my friends, Donna, told me a story recently that clearly showed the { force ### strength ### power ### energy } of support.
Several years ago, Donna had just broken up with her boyfriend of two years and she was having a very { tough ### excited ### rushed ### strange } time, accepting the loss.
She refused to be { accompanied ### accomplished ### accelerated ### acknowledged } and stayed at home alone, which certainly was not helping.
She just couldn't { stand ### hide ### stop ### bear } crying all the time.
Early one morning, Donna received a phone call with some { terrific ### exciting ### horrible ### terrible } news : a car accident had stop her best friend's brother's life .
Early one morning, Donna received a phone call with some accompanied news : a car accident had { killed ### deprived ### seized ### claimed } her best friend's brother's life .
Donna had known this friend, Mary, and her brother { fairly ### nearly ### barely ### rarely } her entire life, and the news was destructive.
Donna { overcame ### gathered ### recognized ### changed } her sadness and got in the car as soon as possible, driving to her friend's house to be with her.
During that time she hardly felt any { warmth ### happiness ### love ### pain } in her heart.
Several weeks later, when life began to return to { normal ### often ### average ### common } , Donna realized the level of support she had given Mary far overtook any support she had nearly herself during her dark time .
Several weeks later, when life began to return to claimed , Donna realized the level of support she had given Mary far overtook any support she had { reduced ### offered ### protected ### avoided } herself during her dark time .
She was able to use the support she had given her friend as a { candle ### gift ### torch ### mirror } for the support she needed.
When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was { planting ### examining ### watching ### cutting } trees.
His house sat on ten acres , and his life's goal was to make it a { hospital ### forest ### park ### garden } .
The good doctor had some interesting { instructions ### experiences ### theories ### experiments } concerning planting trees.
He never { covered ### shook ### watered ### pulled } his new trees.
Once I asked why. Watering plants will { strengthen ### enlarge ### drown ### spoil } them.
So you have to make things { rough ### easy ### smooth ### pleasant } for them.
He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow { countless ### numerous ### deep ### limited } roots in search of water.
He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd { protect ### fasten ### appreciate ### beat } it with a rolled-up newspaper.
I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's { patience ### growth ### attention ### movement } .
Every now and again, I returned and walked by his { laboratory ### house ### office ### clinic } and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago.
They're incredibly { dead ### broken ### weak ### strong } now.
Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two { trees ### sons ### works ### houses } .
I stand over them and pray for them. { Mostly ### Occasionally ### Scarcely ### Loudly } I pray that their lives will be easy.
But lately I've been thinking that it's time to change my { mind ### decision ### direction ### prayer } .
Too many times we pray for { gifts ### reunion ### ease ### freedom } , but that's a prayer seldom met.
What we need to do is pray for { branches ### leaves ### tops ### roots } that reach deep into the earth so that they won't be swept apart when the rains fall and the winds blow.
Monday was the first day she went to work, so she was very { depressed ### encouraged ### excited ### surprised } and arrived early.
She { turned ### pushed ### knocked ### forced } the door open and found nobody there.
I am the { last ### second ### third ### first } to arrive.
She was surprised to find a bunch of { keys ### grapes ### flowers ### bananas } on it.
They were fresh. She { smelled ### ate ### took ### held } them and they were sweet.
She looked around for a { vase ### room ### glass ### bottle } to put them in.
Somebody has sent me flowers the very first day! she thought { angrily ### quietly ### strangely ### happily } .
But who could it be? she began to { seek ### wonder ### Work ### ask } .
The day passed quickly and Nancy did everything with { low ### little ### great ### general } interest.
For the following days of the { month ### period ### year ### week } , the first thing Nancy did was to change water for the followers and then set about her work.
 { Unless ### When ### Since ### Before } she came near her desk she was overjoyed to see a(n) new bunch of flowers there .
 When she came near her desk she was overjoyed to see a(n) { old ### red ### blue ### new } bunch of flowers there .
Then came another Monday. She quickly put them in the vase, { covering ### demanding ### replacing ### forbidding } the old ones.
Nancy began to think of ways to find out the { sender ### receiver ### secretary ### waiter } .
On Tuesday afternoon, she was sent to hand in a plan to the { assistant ### colleague ### employee ### manager } .
She waited for his directives at his secretary's { notebook ### desk ### office ### house } .
She happened to see on the desk a half-opened notebook, which { said ### written ### printed ### signed } : In order to keep the secretaries in high spirits , the company has decided that every Monday morning a bunch of fresh flowers should be put on each secretary's desk.
With tears { flying ### putting ### rolling ### taking } down his face, a gentleman said in an interview.
The gentleman, whose { mother ### friend ### daughter ### wife } had just died in an accident, was answering the reporter's question, What would you do differently if you had known you might not see your wife again ?
The gentleman, whose wife had just died in an accident, was answering the reporter's question, What would you do { practically ### carefully ### usually ### differently } if you had known you might not see your wife again ?
Of course, we would all act differently { while ### if ### although ### unless } we knew our time together with our love was running out.
Back at the house, starting a load of laundry, I found myself thinking about the { information ### interview ### match ### scenery } .
I would do something special { played ### sang ### jumped ### lived } over and over again in my mind.
That gentleman would never have that { desire ### wish ### intention ### opportunity } , but I did.
I hope my husband, Alan, and I have { other ### some ### all ### another } forty years together.
But there are no guarantees. Tomorrows are not { pretended ### provided ### guaranteed ### imagined } .
When doing the washing, I had a little problem: I couldn't { find ### start ### control ### suffer } the washing machine.
Suddenly I found it very important for me to fix the machine and give Alan a { delight ### gift ### surprise ### lesson } .
Then I began to { check ### wonder ### worry ### guess } what was wrong.
Several { businesses ### experiments ### months ### attempts } later, with no improvement and an aching arm, I thought I might not check .
Several surprise later, with no improvement and an aching arm, I thought I might not { succeed ### survive ### submit ### fail } .
But thinking about that gentleman's words, I decided to { keep ### catch ### turn ### move } on trying.
The motor finally started and that day Alan was really { frightened ### surprised ### angry ### puzzled } at my work.
I was { grateful ### sorry ### shameful ### delighted } for the lessons I learned that day.
 { Through ### Without ### Beyond ### Across } his pain, the gentleman who had lost his love taught me to keep what was mine .
 succeed his pain, the gentleman who had lost his love taught me to { protect ### discover ### treasure ### seek } what was mine .
But that had never been a(n) { problem ### mistake ### excuse ### topic } for him ; they had started calling him Cheerful Charlie because of his joyful and enthusiastic nature .
But that had never been a(n) problem for him ; they had started calling him Cheerful Charlie because of his joyful and { sensitive ### humorous ### responsible ### enthusiastic } nature .
There wasn't a postman, or a taxi driver who wasn't { surprised ### moved ### pleased ### disappointed } to see Charlie.
Cheer up, Mr. Postman, that way you'll { send ### write ### print ### find } more letters today!
Taxi Driver. You { paint ### play ### park ### repair } that thing better than anyone else.
He also had great ideas and { opportunities ### solutions ### comments ### impressions } for everything ; and he shared them so generously that, just about every day in that town, someone did a great job, or park something new, thanks to Charlie's ideas .
He also had great ideas and send for everything ; and he shared them so generously that, just about every day in that town, someone did a great job, or { cleared ### noticed ### enjoyed ### invented } something new, thanks to Charlie's ideas .
One day, though, he came up against a real { difficulty ### surprise ### risk ### disaster } .
No matter what Charlie said to him, Waterworks would always find some { means ### reason ### method ### value } to be sad: I don't have many sweets... my parents didn't buy me that toy... Everything seemed so bad to him.
But Cheerful Charlie wasn't going to be let down , and he kept spending more time with Waterworks, { hardly ### quickly ### constantly ### specially } trying to cheer him up, just as he did with everyone.
Then, one day, when they were together in the street, someone { aimed ### moved ### threw ### dropped } a pie from a window above by chance, and it landed difficulty on Charlie's head .
Then, one day, when they were together in the street, someone invented a pie from a window above by chance, and it landed { ahead ### right ### almost ### even } on Charlie's head .
He was speechless, and although Waterworks was just about to cry, he { missed ### loved ### envied ### wanted } Charlie's happy words so much that he finally said, Wow, Charlie, that's a nice clown mask you just put on!
On saying those words, Waterworks felt so { ordinary ### sorry ### good ### curious } that he finally understood why Charlie was always so happy and cheerful.
There is { much ### nothing ### something ### none } wrong with curiosity in itself .
Whether it is good or bad { keeps ### puts ### takes ### depends } on what people are curious about .
Some persons with nothing to do are { full ### fond ### proud ### out } of curiosity about what their neighbours are doing .

my husband, Roy, asked when I answered the telephone. I { plan ### refuse ### fail ### agree } to, I said.
My money was { private ### enough ### endless ### limited } and I knew I had to be creative in my shopping that day.
For a few seconds, Roy sat { nervously ### silently ### friendly ### excitedly } on the other end of the line.
Why do you ask? I whispered, { arranging ### receiving ### fearing ### blaming } what he might say.
Nancy, there's a family with six kids that will not have anything to { eat ### do ### pay ### say } for Thanksgiving.
While you're at the store could you { freely ### possibly ### gently ### regularly } buy something for them?
My head began to spin when I was thinking about the fifty dollars I had { lent ### pulled ### hidden ### saved } for our family's Thanksgiving dinner.
In the back of my mind I { invited ### organized ### counted ### connected } the hungry guests who would be coming to our house for dinner.
I put my head down on my desk, already feeling { affected ### defeated ### satisfied ### bored } .
But the compassion I heard in my husband's { voice ### face ### heart ### body } struck a nerve inside me.
I replied, { Bad ### Poor ### Sure ### Afraid } but only if God helps.
I finished my work and { angered ### worried ### wondered ### prayed } all the way to the nearest grocery store.
I entered the parking lot and noticed a big 28 { flower ### sign ### book ### word } in the grocery store window: Turkeys---29 cents a pound.
I went inside, but when I read the sign my heart { sank ### fell ### ended ### held } .
But I needed at least two so I decided to find the manager. I { explained ### promised ### required ### corrected } the problem.
He made an exception. To my { horror ### sadness ### credit ### surprise } , I had enough money.
I was even able to purchase a package of cookies for the five-year-old child who had { broken ### stolen ### operated ### supported } my heart, even though I had never met her.
Later that afternoon, Roy and I made a special delivery to a home { covered ### shaped ### filled ### made } with children of all ages.
I will never forget the { sorrow ### loneliness ### disappointment ### smiles } on the six kids' faces.
By far, that was the greatest { year ### season ### Thanksgiving ### reward } of my life.
He wanted to watch a { gift ### bargain ### game ### film } for all the hard work he put in this year in school.
He was diagnosed with ADHD ,but { managed ### remembered ### failed ### dreamt } to be on the honor roll for half the school year.
I am so incredibly { informed ### proud ### aware ### afraid } of him !
Besides,this child of mine has the most { heavy ### weak ### frightening ### loving } heart and always sends love to others .
We went to the ticket office. We stood in the { queue ### dark ### wild ### future } and waited for our turn .
We went to the ticket office. We stood in the queue and waited for our { freedom ### turn ### guest ### result } .
He spotted Nic too and let Nic buy his ticket first when his turn { finished ### came ### waited ### jumped } .
Nic asked me { how ### why ### if ### when } he could give the young man a smile card we made on our own .
I nodded my head,so he { performed ### climbed ### drove ### marched } right up to that man and said Thank you!
and { handed ### bought ### lent ### owed } him the card.
I have never { wiped ### returned ### seen ### forced } two bigger smiles in my life.
After we watched the popular game,as we were { observing ### admiring ### leaving ### introducing } the football stadium,we walked back through the ticket office.
We each had five smile cards left. We just { started ### minded ### practiced ### regretted } handing them out.
I { trained ### employed ### needed ### chose } two construction workers who had just gone off work and it was only noon.
I will never { forget ### recognize ### mention ### require } one of the men's faces.
He looked so { surprised ### tired ### polite ### friendly } .
However,when I just set the { ticket ### paper ### standard ### card } before him and said Have a great day !
His smile has kept me { running ### going ### crying ### drinking } all day, This has been one of the card and one of the worst days of my life .
His smile has kept me tired all day, This has been one of the { latest ### coldest ### best ### saddest } and one of the worst days of my life .
Do you let a bad driver, impolite waiter, rude boss, or an insensitive employee { injure ### ruin ### hurt ### harm } your day?
One day I was in a taxi and we headed { through ### from ### in ### for } the airport.
We were driving in the right lane { while ### when ### since ### as } suddenly a black car drove out of a parking space right in front of us.
My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, slide sideways, and at the very last moment our car stopped and narrowly { knocked ### overtook ### missed ### left } the other car by just inches !
The driver of the other car looked around and started { laughing ### throwing ### glancing ### yelling } at us .
My taxi driver just { wondered ### smiled ### ignored ### guessed } and waved at the guy.
And I mean he was really { friendly ### angry ### frightened ### disappointed } .
He { showed ### suggested ### explained ### hated } that many people are like garbage trucks.
They run around full of { expectation ### passengers ### garbage ### goods } , full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment.
As their garbage { turns ### pushes ### holds ### piles } up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on you .
As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on { roads ### children ### you ### dustbins } .
Believe me. You'll be more { healthy ### happy ### pitiful ### wealthy } .
Don't take their garbage and { spread ### share ### explain ### contribute } it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets, Life's too short to wake up in the morning with happy .
Don't take their garbage and you it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets, Life's too short to wake up in the morning with { surprise ### pleasure ### doubt ### regrets } .

Roy Baumeister, a psychology researcher from Florida State University, found in his extensive research that you { remember ### forget ### value ### appreciate } bad things more often than good things in your life.
You store the bad memories rather easily, and you { enjoy ### exchange ### recall ### imagine } them more frequently.
Life is ten percent what you make it and ninety percent how you { inspire ### take ### mend ### notice } it!
You make room for the good by { letting ### consisting ### making ### dreaming } go of the bad.
Have a Garbage Free Day!Have a marvelous, garbage-free day!The seeds you plant today { distinguish ### deserve ### deliver ### determine } the harvest you reap tomorrow.

My dad { refused ### had ### learned ### stopped } a bone marrow transplant operation, and after that he was able to reuse his own cleaned marrow, so a donor was not needed.
That was excellent { expression ### knowledge ### news ### sense } because donors who are a match are hard to come by.

One day the king and his friend were out on a hunting { expectation ### experience ### expedition ### experiment } .
The friend would { prepare ### arrange ### carry ### hold } the guns for the king.
But this time he had { deliberately ### apparently ### naturally ### specially } done something wrong in preparing one of the guns, for after taking the gun from his friend, the king fired it and his thumb was blown off.
Examining the { thumb ### king ### gun ### situation } the friend remarked as usual, This is good!
to which the king replied, No, this is NOT good! and { angrily ### calmly ### regretfully ### joyfully } imprisoned his friend.
Cannibals { caught ### warned ### robbed ### hunted } him and took him to their village.
They tied his hands, set up a wooden post and { connected ### related ### wrapped ### fastened } him to it.
As they came close to set fire to burn the king, they { observed ### understood ### noticed ### complained } that the king was missing a thumb.
So { untying ### forgiving ### overlooking ### beating } the king, they sent him on his way.
As he returned home, he was { recalled ### accused ### informed ### reminded } of the event that had taken his thumb and felt sorry for his treatment of his friend.
He went immediately to the { house ### jail ### village ### kingdom } to speak with his friend.
Then he { stopped ### hesitated ### continued ### refused } to tell the friend all that had just happened.
I feel { fortunate ### foolish ### guilty ### painful } for sending you to jail for so long.
If I had NOT been in jail, I would have been with you, and I would have been { burnt ### cooked ### fired ### eaten } !

I'm to know your { wisdom ### experience ### method ### explanation } .
I'm very { glad ### nervous ### bitter ### sorry } about that mistake, answered the student.
After the examination, I { realized ### understood ### remembered ### suffered } what I should have done.
I mostly went to { church ### school ### war ### work } with other kids whose parents were also in the military.
But when my dad { separated ### withdrew ### quit ### retired } from the Marines after twenty years of service, I found myself attending a civilian school with twelve-year-olds who shared no similar life experience with me .
But when my dad retired from the Marines after twenty years of service, I found myself { visiting ### running ### attending ### leaving } a civilian school with twelve-year-olds who shared no similar life experience with me .
Everyone in my class had grown up together, and they had no room to { spare ### preserve ### take ### build } for a newcomer.
I { played ### struggled ### fought ### exercised } for the first few weeks of school.
I had no friends, no activities, and no { memory ### control ### need ### promise } of a bright future.
To deal with it all, I began { reading ### drawing ### copying ### writing } in my diary every day---stories of adventure, of old friends, of feelings that I could not speak.
I wrote as if my life depended on it, as if the very next breath I took could not happen { once ### unless ### while ### after } I wrote down words.
I told her I enjoyed writing and { compared ### applied ### preferred ### turned } writing to playing.
I was { excited ### satisfied ### astonished ### embarrassed } that I could now participate in something I knew I excelled in.
That night I worked and worked on the essay. I wrote with great { passion ### curiosity ### wonder ### anxiety } .
It was my one chance to feel important and { impressed ### challenged ### accepted ### envied } by the class.
A few days after we handed in our assignments, Mrs. Bush called me up to the { corner ### front ### door ### outside } of the classroom.
I stood before thirty pairs of eyes looking at me, and I got { annoyed ### disappointed ### surprised ### worried } .
Then Mrs. Bush told the class how much she { expected ### appreciated ### recognized ### enjoyed } all the work that went into the essay and everyone had done a great job.
But, she said, one student stood { out ### up ### by ### off } as an excellent writer, one with imagination, creativity, and word mastery.
The class clapped politely and Mrs. Bush handed me my paper, with the following { descriptions ### remarks ### suggestions ### accounts } on it: Malinda, you are an excellent writer.
Please keep on writing and share your { advantage ### purpose ### gift ### idea } of writing with the world.
Mrs. Bush helped me feel a sense of { responsibility ### devotion ### belonging ### relief } , a place of purpose, and a way to survive a transition in life.
She helped me gain { interest ### imagination ### creativity ### confidence } in myself that stayed with me beyond sixth grade.
I { preferred ### missed ### wondered ### remembered } her terribly.
I was told I was her favorite { relative ### neighbor ### partner ### grandchild } ; she was my favorite Granny.
My heart { touched ### felt ### ached ### flew } for a long time after we went away.
Mother must have noticed I wanted to see her, { so ### but ### still ### and } she would take my brother and me back to visit my Granny sometimes .
Mother must have noticed I wanted to see her, so she would take my { aunt ### cousin ### sister ### brother } and me back to visit my Granny sometimes .

I know Granny loved us. so it was something you could feel with your { thoughts ### eyes ### mind ### heart } .
She didn't live in a fancy house or have { powerful ### expensive ### familiar ### large } things, but I never cared.
Although she didn't have much, { either ### none ### nor ### so } did we, she did something for my brother Tommie and me.
I will always remember she saved her { pennies ### candies ### jewels ### sweets } in a glass jar, which had belonged to her since she was married.
I am sure Granny could have { protected ### saved ### used ### collected } those pennies herself but she saved them to expensive us when we came to visit .
I am sure Granny could have heart those pennies herself but she saved them to { help ### give ### attract ### comfort } us when we came to visit .
Because I was the older, I was in charge of dividing the pennies { legally ### logically ### informally ### equally } between my brother and me.
One for you, one for me, I would { ignore ### appreciate ### request ### repeat } the words until the jar was empty.
I don't remember how much we collected on our { visits ### holidays ### weekends ### youth } and the amount wasn't important at all.
It was the idea that she remembered us and cared about us { which ### that ### where ### what } moved me.
Those { performances ### sights ### memories ### accidents } of my childhood still give me warm feelings when I'm sad.
I often wonder if I found a penny { lying ### burying ### shining ### signaling } on the ground somewhere, could it possibly be Granny tossing me pennies from heaven?
It's not because I'm { smart ### lazy ### tired ### desperate } or that I don't care if my kids have a good party.
I am just not good at making homemade bread into holiday-themed shapes like other mothers. { However ### Therefore ### Otherwise ### Besides } , I'm happy to try, even though it'll take me a long time to do it .

So { unless ### because ### though ### when } I couldn't make the turkey-shaped cookies, I ended up feeling like a failure as a mom.
After many { failed ### careless ### successful ### useful } attempts at baking, and many afternoons spent crying over my inabilities as a mother, I finally accepted the treasure that my lot in life is to be the juice box mom .
After many ability attempts at baking, and many afternoons spent crying over my inabilities as a mother, I finally accepted the { goal ### opinion ### fact ### impression } that my lot in life is to be the juice box mom .
I worked hard to be the { slowest ### best ### worst ### quickest } one in the elementary school.
Her teacher stopped me as I was leaving and said, Thank you so much for always bringing { cold ### soft ### extra ### fresh } drinks.
Sometimes parents forget that other children will also { attend ### hold ### enjoy ### leave } class parties, and they end up being left out because we don't have enough when for everyone .
Sometimes parents forget that other children will also upset class parties, and they end up being left out because we don't have enough { cookies ### drinks ### books ### cups } for everyone .
I just accepted her appreciation, rather than telling her that I brought extra drinks because I could { already ### always ### ever ### never } remember how many kids were in the class.
But her { contribution ### appreciation ### congratulation ### comprehension } taught me an important lesson: I'm not a failure as a mom.
Not everyone is cut out to be a(n) { loyal ### clever ### able ### rich } mom.
I may not bake cookies and decorate them beautifully, but I { provide ### make ### buy ### retell } something to drink.
And I think that's just as { believable ### ridiculous ### interesting ### important } .
He would never get home; it was { hopeless ### useless ### careless ### timeless } .

When he returned home, the engineer told the { news ### result ### secret ### story } to Dr Price.
Not until years later did it become a(n) { recognized ### accepted ### solved ### explained } fact that this was just an everyday lifeguard doing its work.
For what the engineer did, by eating fish eyes, was to { keep ### bring ### take ### try } vitamin .
Vitamin A's biggest job is to keep the eyes { working ### rolling ### moving ### going } .

As a young boy, I struggled to achieve tasks that came { smoothly ### easily ### frequently ### strongly } to most .
I did not talk the way { average ### ordinary ### common ### normal } kids did and did not respond to questions or stay alert to my surroundings .
My reading was poor { just ### even ### ever ### only } with teachers helping me, and my speech was hard to understand .

My mother { suffered ### removed ### observed ### experienced } all my challenges and, as a professor with a Ph .
D . , decided to { study ### change ### find ### keep } the situation early in my development .
She did not want me to { fight ### strike ### struggle ### challenge } .
After a while, { she ### we ### they ### I } did indeed conquer all the problems that had troubled me .
She spent hours every day { teaching ### giving ### supporting ### reminding } me everything I needed to know, determined to help me learn .
 { Besides ### Except ### Without ### Beyond } her I would not be anywhere close to the level I am now.

Learning experiences happen to us throughout our lives, and not too long ago, I had one that I would like to { introduce ### perform ### share ### explain } .
This story began with a { game ### trip ### party ### race } three years ago.
I was going to Marblehead, Massachusetts, with my racing team on the highway and we were all { late ### hungry ### lost ### slow } Luckily, we saw a rest area ahead .
I was going to Marblehead, Massachusetts, with my racing team on the highway and we were all hungry Luckily, we saw a rest area { inside ### behind ### below ### ahead } .
I had a brand-new US $ 20 bill, and I had { even ### once ### never ### ever } had that kind of cash before.
Spending it on food { proved ### showed ### turned ### seemed } to me like throwing it away.
We all rushed into the pizza line. { Gradually ### Finally ### Usually ### Lately } I got a cheese pizza and drink.
Halfway through the { meal ### journey ### talk ### job } , I realized I had not actually Finally any money to the cashier .
Halfway through the seemed , I realized I had not actually { returned ### offered ### handed ### supplied } any money to the cashier .
I was so upset that I refused to give myself the { pleasure ### chance ### idea ### effort } of an ice cream in fear that someone would say, Hey, Jeff, why don't you Finally the change from the pizza instead of that nice, new US $20 bill ?
I was so upset that I refused to give myself the seemed of an ice cream in fear that someone would say, Hey, Jeff, why don't you { find ### receive ### use ### return } the change from the pizza instead of that nice, new US $20 bill ?

For the next two years, whenever I was seemed of the Pizza incident, I { fixed ### closed ### raised ### wiped } my eyes and said to myself, Not gonna think about it, not gonna think about it .
I think this { brings ### concerns ### impresses ### reflects } the saying, A coward dies a thousand deaths, a hero dies Finally .
I think this seemed the saying, A coward dies a thousand deaths, a hero dies { more ### less ### one ### none } .
I was a coward and have felt { terrible ### puzzled ### nervous ### curious } about that incident at least a thousand times.
If I had been a hero and gone { away ### back ### near ### out } up to pay for the pizza, then I would have felt a little embarrassed about it only once, or maybe twice.
 { Therefore ### Yet ### Instead ### Besides } he sets aside his simple ways when we dine out.
Unlike his relatives who enter a restaurant armed with calculators to make sure they never { overtip ### overspend ### overcharge ### overwaste } , my husband adds 5 percent each time the accepted tip standard increases .

He hasn't analyzed why he tips so generously, but I think the habit { developed ### resulted ### appeared ### changed } from his high school years, when he worked as a busboy and got tips from people he served.
Over the years, out growing boys would suggest that Dad let them { order ### choose ### book ### ask } dessert rather than tip so much.
He stood firm { for ### to ### against ### upon } their strong demands.
Our sons and I have { decided ### agreed ### come ### happened } to accept his habit.
We recently { helped ### requested ### treated ### cooked } our son's girlfriend to seafood.

I asked, wondering if he had done something { demanding ### ashamed ### unreasonable ### puzzling } or made acalculation error.
She gave us great service. I just thought she deserved a big { rise ### reward ### pay ### prize } in tips .
It wasn't until later when I overheard our son retelling the story of the grateful waitress that I realized she had given my family something { littlemorethan ### morethan ### ratherthan ### otherthan } a thank you .
She showed our son the { importance ### situation ### meaning ### effort } of recognizing hard work.
Her show of gratitudehelped a dad earn a bit more { attention ### care ### praise ### respect } from a loving son.
And it reminded me just why I married this { easy-going ### thoughtful ### tough ### serious } , caring man.
These tales so { moved ### shocked ### excited ### scared } the farmer that he could hardly wait to sell his farm and go searching for diamonds himself.
So he sold the farm and { devoted ### spent ### took ### concentrated } the rest of.

The farmer was { astonished ### satisfied ### moved ### encouraged } .
He told the man thathis stream was full of these { interesting ### worthless ### ordinary ### brilliant } stones, and that his farmland was covered with them.
Needless to say, the { farm ### diamond ### stream ### stone } the first farmer had sold,so that he couldhunt for a diamond mine, turned out to be the most productive diamond mine on the entire African continent.

She had been state along a country road when she had been stopped by a flying saucer { flew ### flying ### landing ### landed } in front of her .

It was as though they could read her thoughts and she could read { theirs ### their ### her ### hers } .
They tested her politely and allowed her to { leave ### stay ### drive ### watch } after carrying out a number of tests on her.
As she otherwise seemed to be { happy ### normal ### nervous ### thankful } , the doctor decided that she was probably suffering from the side effects of some medicine.
The woman insisted on being { allowed ### told ### advised ### ordered } to go home, but when she gave her landing , it was in a town over thousand miles from the enter .

To the murderer, or the bank robber, these are the most { exciting ### frightening ### disappointing ### depressing } words in the world.
When the criminal hears them, he knows that 6,000 { educated ### selected ### trained ### deserted } persons are after him.
There are thousands of cities and { houses ### factories ### hotels ### villages } where he can hide, and forests and deserts, as well.
 { Besides ### However ### Therefore ### Instead } , he's usually rich with stolen money.
 { Forests ### Cities ### Money ### Food } can make it easier to hide.
With money, the criminal can even pay a doctor to { judge ### operate ### draw ### mask } on his face and make him hard to recognize.
But the criminals know that as public { officials ### officers ### friends ### enemies } , they can be found by the FBI no matter where they hide.
If he makes just one { mistake ### movement ### motivation ### murder } , they'll get him.
That's why the criminal who is { checked ### wanted ### examined ### targeted } can't sleep.
That's why he becomes nervous, why he jumps at every { step ### glance ### sound ### corner } .
What we need is a { wholly ### partly ### briefly ### simply } new kind of police force, he said, Criminals today are smart .
What we need is a wholly new kind of police force, he said, { Lawyers ### Policemen ### Citizens ### Criminals } today are smart .
They have learned to { close ### open ### make ### destroy } any lock, using advanced technology.
We have to train officers to { work ### study ### interview ### develop } scientifically.
He wanted only men with good manners and good { appearances ### eyesight ### tongues ### character } .
When working { for ### as ### with ### at } his officers, they would have to meet all kinds of people.
Hoover wanted men who could { handle ### get ### block ### afford } a teacup as well as a gun.
But the FBI cannot help in { tiny ### other ### every ### special } police problem.
Solving all other crimes is the { right ### task ### power ### duty } of local police forces.
A strange { sound ### noise ### voice ### shout } on the other end spoke to me, Dad, please come back soon.
I miss you so much! I judged that it was a { bad ### different ### unlucky ### wrong } number.
A little while later, the call came once again, so I rudely { refused ### explained ### returned ### answered } , You've dialed the wrong number!
and then hung off . During the following days, I got the same { number ### call ### telephone ### result } now and then.
I miss you so much! Dad, I'm { of ### on ### in ### at } so much pain!
Mom said you were too busy to take { care ### control ### attention ### interest } of me.
But, dad, please { support ### kiss ### treat ### encourage } me again, OK?
The innocent { condition ### suggestion ### request ### advice } was difficult to refuse.
I made a { soft ### sweet ### low ### loud } kiss on the phone and heard the weak voice say, Thank you...Dad, I am so...happy, so...happy...
Shortly after this, I became { surprised ### curious ### cruel ### amazed } about who had been on the other end of my phone.
I am really sorry to have { bothered ### warned ### interrupted ### calmed } you.
My daughter has suffered from bone cancer { when ### since ### as ### after } she was born.
And her father... died in an { invitation ### event ### accident ### experiment } a short while ago.
I dare not tell her this sad { experience ### reason ### story ### news } .
Poor baby.When she couldn't bear the painful chemotherapy , she would cry for her dad, who had always { encouraged ### supported ### satisfied ### praised } her.
I couldn't { help ### wait ### expect ### want } to ask.
She's { survived ### passed ### gone ### escaped } .
You must have kissed her on the phone, because she passed away with a smile, tightly holding the cell phone... { Tears ### Cries ### Anger ### Disappointment } filled my eyes and I was so sad to hear that.
A little girl's voice on the other end { shouted ### cried ### screamed ### called } , Dad, please come back soon.
Instinctively , I knew it was a(n) { unfit ### unfriendly ### wrong ### false } number, so I rudely replied , You've dialed the wrong number !

The innocent { demand ### command ### request ### require } was difficult to reject.
I made a loud kiss on the phone and heard the { low ### deep ### soft ### weak } voice say, Thank you ... Dad, I am so ... happy, so ... happy ...
Shortly after this, I became { curious ### interested ### surprised ### amazed } about who had been on the other end of my phone.
I am really sorry to have { confused ### bothered ### displeased ### upset } you.
My daughter has suffered from bone cancer { until ### when ### while ### since } she was born.
And her father died in an { incident ### event ### accident ### affair } a short while ago.
I { must ### dare ### need ### should } not tell her this news.

I ended up taking a lot of { exercise ### interests ### trouble ### tricks } especially from the boys, because of my appearance.
I became an extremely { brave ### shy ### graceful ### selfish } young lady.
One day { someone ### everyone ### none ### anyone } in the 6th grade class was told by Mr .
Hadley that we would be { allowed ### required ### advised ### warned } to stand up in front of the class and read the reports that we had completed .
Hadley that we would be required to stand up in front of the class and read the { newspapers ### reports ### experiences ### texts } that we had completed .
When my turn came, I { refused ### decided ### promised ### pretended } to stand up in front of all those students and open up to their tricks.
Mr. Hadley came over to me and again { asked ### forced ### ordered ### permitted } me to read my report.
He walked to the front of the { teacher ### classroom ### blackboard ### class } and said, Yvonne has a very good report here and I think everyone asked to hear her read it .
He walked to the front of the refused and said, Yvonne has a very good report here and I think everyone { likes ### hates ### needs ### dares } to hear her read it .
If I hear anyone making { quiet ### strange ### special ### little } noises or making fun of her in any way, I will let you fail right here and now.
Mr. Hadley walked back to me and { left ### dropped ### offered ### handed } me the paper, asking me to go to the front of the class.
I walked to the front of the class on legs { which ### what ### where ### that } were shaking and I felt a(n) needs in my chest .
I walked to the front of the class on legs class were shaking and I felt a(n) { rabbit ### idea ### warmth ### coldness } in my chest .
I stood there trying to gain { strength ### excuse ### calm ### encouragement } .
I have { dependence ### support ### confidence ### result } in you!
I { read ### recited ### announced ### described } the report and instead of the kids laughing at me and making fun of me, they all stood up and clapped their hands.
From that day on the kids never made fun of me again and some { definitely ### fortunately ### surprisingly ### actually } made friends with me.
I continued to be quite shy all through school { but ### and ### so ### though } from that day on I knew if I had to stand up in front of class again.
They lived in a big house close to the { cave ### seaside ### river ### farm } .
I like that area very much, because there is a cinema, a swimming pool and a { school ### park ### garden ### zoo } .
I got along very well with Joan. We shared many { similar ### intelligent ### patient ### unreliable } interests.
Sometimes we swam in the sea if the { diploma ### nuisance ### facility ### weather } was nice.
We went to the zoo and I really { admitted ### avoided ### enjoyed ### considered } seeing those wild animals and the trained ones .
We went to the zoo and I really enjoyed seeing those wild animals and the { abandoned ### trained ### injured ### killed } ones .

Brisbane is about 1 000 kilometres { far ### in ### around ### away } from Sydney, so it's not a short distance.
 { Otherwise ### Therefore ### However ### Meanwhile } , we went there by plane.
The journey by plane was quite fast and { comfortable ### disappointing ### boring ### astonishing } and it took us only two hours to get there.
When I got { on ### over ### up ### off } the plane, I was so excited to see this modern city.
The { discipline ### diamond ### scenery ### summary } in Sydney was absolutely beautiful and the food there was well-cooked.
They even { brought ### allowed ### hesitated ### treated } me to some very expensive lobster .
That was the first time I had eaten lobster, and I { must ### shall ### may ### might } say it was really delicious.
The whole trip was very enjoyable { beside ### besides ### except ### for } the last day.
However, it rained the whole day. We { floated ### contacted ### spent ### remained } in the hotel that day and chatted.
In the end, we decided to go back to Brisbane by { bus ### train ### ship ### plane } , because the ticket was cheaper and also we could enjoy the scenery outside the train windows.
On the whole, I really had a great time in Australia. It was a { brilliant ### enthusiastic ### energetic ### annoying } trip.
Earthquakes are { common ### familiar ### strange ### unusual } , and thousands of them happen each day .
During a { real ### small ### big ### weak } earthquake, there is often a great noise first .
Then the earth { moves ### breaks ### jumps ### shakes } terribly and many houses fall down .

Besides the great damage and deaths caused by the earthquake shakes , other disasters such as fires often { follow ### enter ### come ### copy } .
. . More buildings are destroyed and more { quakes ### results ### difficulties ### deaths } are caused .
It is well known of the { information ### problems ### dangers ### questions } of a possible earthquake, and for centuries man has been making researches on earthquakes .
More than 2,000 years ago, for example , a Chinese scientist named Zhang Heng { invented ### bought ### found ### discovered } a machine which could find out from which destroyed the seismic waves had come, and this machine is still itself by scientists today .
More than 2,000 years ago, for example , a Chinese scientist named Zhang Heng off a machine which could find out from which { country ### city ### way ### direction } the seismic waves had come, and this machine is still itself by scientists today .
More than 2,000 years ago, for example , a Chinese scientist named Zhang Heng off a machine which could find out from which destroyed the seismic waves had come, and this machine is still { improved ### used ### protected ### repaired } by scientists today .
Now we know much more about earthquakes and { where ### why ### what ### when } they happen, but we still cannot destroyed exactly when and where an earthquake will happen, and cannot itself it from happening .
Now we know much more about earthquakes and off they happen, but we still cannot { speak ### point ### talk ### tell } exactly when and where an earthquake will happen, and cannot itself it from happening .
Now we know much more about earthquakes and off they happen, but we still cannot destroyed exactly when and where an earthquake will happen, and cannot { make ### let ### stop ### prepare } it from happening .
So earthquakes are among the { worst ### fast ### most ### best } disasters in the world .
 { However ### So ### And ### But } , scientists can help stop earthquakes destroying the whole cities and causing too many deaths.
A few weeks ago, I followed a friend into an art supply store.I found him picking out tubes of water-color paint, which { surprised ### moved ### pleased ### excited } me because he's not an artist.
I { made ### took ### signed ### gave } up for a water-color class, and it starts next week, he said.
I really don't have { interest ### concern ### time ### emotion } for it, but it was on my list of 50 things to do before I die, so I went for it.Every few months I look at the list and decide what to focus on next.
 { Because ### After ### Before ### Although } I had the list, I complained a lot about what I was missing in my life .
 Before I had the list, I complained a lot about what I was { doing ### missing ### pushed ### engaged } in my life .
Write your own list . and you'll { admire ### abolish ### spot ### see } what I mean .
The list revealed a whole lot about what was { important ### strange ### beneficial ### special } to me .
It also revealed how { slightly ### slowly ### possibly ### hopelessly } behind I am at getting to the things I really want .
I filled up the first twenty { thoughts ### lists ### ideas ### blanks } quickly, but then began to think carefully.
Eventually I { studied ### added ### dropped ### obtained } items I've thought about for years, and blanks I've carried with me since I was young .
Eventually I hopelessly items I've thought about for years, and { burdens ### challenges ### dreams ### responsibilities } I've carried with me since I was young .
When I { reviewed ### discovered ### wrote ### appreciated } he list later, some entries surprised me .
First, I want to { play ### relax ### travel ### hike. } much more, particularly now that my children are added and can go with me to see the world .
First, I want to blanks much more, particularly now that my children are { wealthier ### cleverer ### healthier ### older } and can go with me to see the world .
I'm also surprised to { write ### put ### find ### leave } some things on the list that need to be done soon.If I'm going to learn to roller-blade , for instance , I'd better start before I turn 50.
Like my friend, I now have an alternative to { complaining ### relaxing ### objecting ### adjusting } .When I'm bored with life, I take out my list.
My friend told me the { problem ### key ### answer ### question } was preparing the ground so that life could work in mysterious ways.
Thanks to my { hobbies ### optimism ### list ### wishes } , I'm working on some big docks.
My foot still hadn't healed from a(n) { slighter ### worse ### earlier ### heavier } injury.
I had { expected ### supposed ### imagined ### doubted } whether or not I should attend the meet.
But there I was, { late ### eager ### ready ### thirsty } for the 3, 000-meter run.
I felt { ashamed ### astonished ### excited ### frightened } as I fell farther and farther behind.
Hooray! shouted the crowd. It was the loudest { cheer ### shout ### cry ### noise } I had ever heard at a meet.
 { Therefore ### Otherwise ### Besides ### However } , I decided to keep going.
During the last two laps, I ran in pain and decided not to { play ### arrive ### race ### attend } in track next year.
It wouldn't be { worth ### good ### valuable ### close } it, even if my foot did heal.
When I finished, I heard a cheer-- { weaker ### longer ### lower ### louder } than the one I'd heard earlier.
I turned around and { well ### sure ### surprisingly ### strangely } enough, the boys were preparing for their race.
I was leaving { while ### when ### as ### since } several girls came up to me.
one of them told me. Courage? I just { finished ### won ### passed ### lost } a race!
Did you hear us? Suddenly I regained { cheer ### hope ### interest ### experience } .
I realized strength and courage aren't always { measured ### praised ### tested ### increased } in medals and victories, but in the sadness we overcome .
I realized strength and courage aren't always praised in medals and victories, but in the { sadness ### struggles ### diseases ### tiredness } we overcome .
The strongest people are not always the people who win, { or ### nor ### and ### but } the people who don't give up when they lose.
She { learns ### adds ### misses ### enjoys } the excitement of school.
How was your { morning ### afternoon ### evening ### night } ?
my daughter replies. That's it. That's all I { get ### need ### plan ### understand } .
She answers me with a few words, but never goes into much { study ### detail ### advice ### work } .
It has only been a few weeks, but I still find it so { strange ### simple ### common ### practical } that my daughter has a whole morning in school without me.
I { always ### just ### even ### never } ask the teachers for details and I am often provided with the same short answers that my daughter gives .
I always ask the teachers for details and I am often provided with the same { satisfying ### funny ### short ### confusing } answers that my daughter gives .
Now, three mornings a week, I close her classroom door behind me and she has her own { direction ### imagination ### influence ### experience } .
I am given some { kindness ### excuses ### evidence ### challenges } of her days like apples glued onto paper trees and paint dirt under her fingernails.
I know she { promises ### achieves ### deserves ### ignores } this privacy and the time to evidence a new environment and meet different kids .
I know she experience this privacy and the time to { remember ### explore ### choose ### consider } a new environment and meet different kids .
 { Then ### Again ### Also ### Still } , I can't help but want to know about the details of her days.
The ride home is the { only ### other ### second ### last } time that she will provide me with some deserves about her morning .
The ride home is the evidence time that she will provide me with some { permission ### information ### devotion ### intention } about her morning .
When we pull into the driveway, I change the { interest ### rule ### conversation ### routine } to something else.
I am sure that my constant questions annoy her, so I try to { take ### guide ### show ### limit } them to the car ride after school.
I am { proud ### disappointed ### anxious ### grateful } that my daughter doesn't quite know our driving route yet ; she can't tell that I sometimes take the long way home, Still we have those few extra minutes together .
I am explore that my daughter doesn't quite know our driving route yet ; she can't tell that I sometimes take the long way home, { although ### because ### so ### or } we have those few extra minutes together .
Most of the { time ### energy ### effort ### money } I spent there was with Mr .
Gillespie . He never had any visitors and nobody seemed to care about his { interests ### requests ### conditions ### opinions } .
I spent many days there holding his hand and talking to him, helping with anything that needed to be done.He became a close friend of mine, even though he responded with only an occasional squeeze of my { hand ### head ### nose ### arm } .
I left for a week to vacation with my parents, and when I came back, Mr. Gillespie was { killed ### lost ### gone ### changed } .
I didn't have the { energy ### chance ### courage ### time } to ask any of the nurses where he was, for fear that they might tell me he had died .
I didn't have the courage to ask any of the nurses where he was, for fear that they might { cheat ### tell ### remind ### warn } me he had died .
Several { days ### weeks ### months ### years } later, when I was a senior in high school, I was at the gas station when I noticed a familiar face .
When I { recognized ### wondered ### heard ### asked } who it was, my eyes filled with tears .
He was { well ### alive ### happy ### alone } !
With an uncertain look { at ### on ### behind ### in } his face, he replied yes .
I { apologized ### remembered ### explained ### admitted } how I knew him and that I had spent many days talking with him in the hospital .
His eyes welled up with tears, and he gave me the warmest hug I had ever { dreamed ### seen ### wanted ### received } .
He began to tell me that { because ### if ### unless ### although } he lay there comatose , he could hear me talking to him and could received me holding his hand the whole time .
He began to tell me that explained he lay there comatose , he could hear me talking to him and could { notice ### feel ### imagine ### watch } me holding his hand the whole time .
Gillespie { hardly ### quickly ### firmly ### nearly } believed that it was my voice and received that had kept him alive .
Gillespie explained believed that it was my voice and { humor ### duty ### touch ### success } that had kept him alive .
Mr . Although I haven't seen him since, he fills my heart with { sorrow ### excitement ### regret ### joy } every day .
I know that I made a(n) { effort ### wish ### difference ### decision } between his life and his death .
He had no cash on him but a brand-new dollar bill with all the autographs of the Opry stars, which he { possessed ### guarded ### worried ### held } carefully and carried with him always.
One morning, he saw a young man { begging ### crying ### sitting ### singing } quietly in an old yellow Dodge in the parking lot.
When he went back to the parking lot that night, he noticed the car again, parked in the { same ### right ### proper ### wrong } space.
The next morning, as Cam walked near the car, the man { turned ### pushed ### rolled ### opened } his window down, introduced himself and said he had been in his car for days with no money or food .
The next morning, as Cam walked near the car, the man rolled his window down, { introduced ### explained ### praised ### told } himself and said he had been in his car for days with no money or food .
Then, very { warmly ### merrily ### rudely ### hesitantly } , the man asked if he might borrow a dollar for a snack to get him by until the next day.
Cam explained his { job ### situation ### car ### hobby } that he didn't have a dollar to lend him.
He walked to his car, wishing he could have { saved ### forgotten ### helped ### missed } him.
Then Cam suddenly { discovered ### remembered ### found ### saw } his Grand Ole Opry dollar.
He { thought ### considered ### searched ### struggled } with his conscience a minute or two, pulled his wallet out and remembered the bill .
He helped with his conscience a minute or two, pulled his wallet out and { touched ### dropped ### smelled ### studied } the bill .
Then he walked back to the man and gave him his { big ### only ### small ### nice } dollar, Somebody has remembered all over this, the man said, but he didn't notice that the writing was dozens of struggled .
Then he walked back to the man and gave him his helped dollar, Somebody has { written ### drawn ### painted ### damaged } all over this, the man said, but he didn't notice that the writing was dozens of struggled .
Then he walked back to the man and gave him his helped dollar, Somebody has remembered all over this, the man said, but he didn't notice that the writing was dozens of { lines ### signatures ### words ### pictures } .
The phone rang; a recording studio wanted him to do a commercial that paid $ 500, which { sounded ### looked ### seemed ### became } like a million.
In the next few days more { news ### phones ### opportunities ### messages } came to him out of nowhere.
Good things kept coming { finally ### steadily ### quickly ### slowly } .
Cam { never ### just ### yet ### still } saw the man in the old yellow Dodge again.
But whether the guy was a { driver ### painter ### helper ### beggar } or an angel doesn't matter.
The students at Sandy's high school were badly shaken by the news that a classmate had { sacrificed ### defeated ### abandoned ### killed } himself .
The suicide note read : It's hard to { live ### imagine ### struggle ### think } when nobody cares .
Glen, a teacher, realized this was a { sad ### final ### teachable ### great } moment about the importance of making people feel valued .
Glen, a teacher, realized this was a teachable moment about the importance of making people feel { ashamed ### valued ### excited ### scared } .
He asked his class to imagine they were about to { die ### fail ### retire ### survive } and to write a note telling someone how and why you valued him or her .
He asked his class to imagine they were about to teachable and to write a note telling someone how and why you { miss ### hate ### admire ### appreciate } him or her .
Sandy, who had a { close ### casual ### bad ### personal } relationship with her mother, decided to write her valued .
Sandy, who had a teachable relationship with her mother, decided to write her { classmate ### mom ### father ### teacher } .
Her letter read : We've had some { free ### delightful ### pleasant ### rough } times and I haven't always been a very good valued , but I know I'm lucky to have you in my life .
Her letter read : We've had some teachable times and I haven't always been a very good { daughter ### student ### friend ### trainer } , but I know I'm lucky to have you in my life .
You're the { best ### wisest ### luckiest ### bravest } person I've ever known .
And even when I disagree with you, I never { trust ### doubt ### consider ### predict } you love me and want what's best for me .
Thanks for not { taking ### going ### giving ### looking } up me .
When her mom read the note, she cried and hugged Sandy { coldly ### hesitantly ### shyly ### tightly } but said little.
The next morning, Sandy found a { note ### gift ### notice ### reminder } on her mirror: Dearest Sandy, I want you to know being your mother is, by far, the most important thing in my life.
 { Since ### Until ### Though ### When } I got your note , I thought I had lost your love and rough .
 mom I got your note , I thought I had lost your love and { confidence ### courage ### respect ### heart } .
I felt like such a failure . I intended to { end ### make ### get ### fall } it all last night .
Your note saved my { life ### time ### money ### honor } .
Be careful not to underestimate the { push ### price ### meaning ### power } of expressed appreciation.
When a woman in a passing car looked up and made eye contact, naturally, I { shouted ### hid ### left ### waved } .
When things were { slow ### bad ### right ### important } , I stood in the window and waved at the passengers who looked up.
And this made me laugh- work { pleasure ### stress ### experience ### challenge } was washed away.
It didn't { spend ### take ### cost ### pay } long to attract the following - a man with a construction truck, the carpool crowd and the business lady with her children....
When waving became { encouraging ### embarrassing ### moving ### boring } , I made signs: Hi!
, Hello! , Be Happy! I { saw ### read ### posted ### painted } them in the window and waved.
Job cuts were announced. Several co-workers would { lose ### seek ### finish ### take } their jobs.

A kind pastor carried her { away ### off ### inside ### out } and found a place for her to sit in the back.
He also told her they could build a { new ### larger ### higher ### modern } Sunday school by raising money.
The pastor didn't see { Hattie ### children ### church ### school } again until he heard from her parents some two years later.
Hattie had sadly died and her parents called for the kind-hearted pastor, who had treated their daughter { fairly ### badly ### well ### equally } , to handle the final arrangements.
As her poor little body was { buried ### hidden ### burnt ### moved } , a worn and wrinkled purse appeared in front of them.
For two years she had saved for this offering of { money ### love ### friendship ### donation } .

A teacher shows three toys to a student .Then she asks the student to find out the { differences ### usage ### weaknesses ### categories } .
All the three toys seem to be { excellent ### simple ### identical ### difficult } in their shape, size and material.
After careful { imagination ### discussion ### observation ### selection } , the student sees holes in the toys.
The first toy has holes in the { mouth ### nose ### eyes ### ears } .
Then with the { invention ### help ### discovery ### company } of a needle, which is put into the holes in one of the ears of the three toys, the student realizes the importance of the company of the people who are trustworthy .

The second toy represents those people who listen to you and all your things and it seems that you { devote ### mean ### teach ### leave } a lot to them.
The needle would not come out in the third toy, which represents those people who will keep the { confidence ### trust ### ambition ### patience } you have in them.
People, who listen to what you tell them, are not { just ### nearly ### always ### already } the ones you can count on when you need them the most.
Although the cat doesn't { mind ### admit ### remember ### realize } this, its body is getting ready for action.
It will { save ### help ### hide ### defend } itself, or it will run away as fast as it can.

Have you ever shouted at a teacher, told someone you were lonely, or said you were in love, and then { hoped ### wished ### blamed ### shared } later you had kept your mouth shut?
It isn't always { useful ### right ### wise ### easy } to express your feelings freely.

That is without doubt, a { personal ### boring ### difficult ### dangerous } situation for any family.
And the { result ### solution ### reward ### review } was a team of fairly frustrated family members.
My biggest frustration was trying to { explain ### describe ### accept ### understand } why he didn't make choices that would allow him to be involved more fully in the lives of his grandchildren .
My biggest frustration was trying to understand why he didn't make choices that would { expect ### allow ### force ### persuade } him to be involved more fully in the lives of his grandchildren .
Yet he { respected ### ignored ### loved ### blamed } each and every one of them.
Every morning he asked my mother which of his grandbabies was going to { leave ### cry ### visit ### perform } that day.
Kids would have the place { set ### messed ### given ### lit } up instantly--toys everywhere, cushions off the couches and the TV channel visit to their station .
Kids would have the place loved up instantly--toys everywhere, cushions off the couches and the TV channel { introduced ### switched ### pointed ### checked } to their station .
Interestingly, he was not at all bothered by the { impression ### alarm ### expression ### noise } or chaos at all.
He was never { careful ### intelligent ### inconvenient ### impatient } with them and he certainly never shouted at any child.
Visits ended with { tears ### quarrels ### tricks ### hugs } and kisses.
I felt that relationship wasn't good enough because he didn't actually do anything { to ### with ### at ### on } my children.
My dad didn't read to the children, and certainly { frequently ### always ### never ### occasionally } played a board game or did a puzzle with them.
He didn't take them out for { walks ### books ### jokes ### interests } or do any of the other things I saw active grandparents doing with their grandchildren.
It made me sad that he was { hoping ### offering ### failing ### promising } to get on with the kids.
A couple of weeks after his death, my 9-year-old daughter turned up in my bedroom at midnight to share a { dream ### plan ### story ### drawing } of him done by herself.
Included in the picture were several messages and { statements ### photos ### suggestions ### problems } --one for each day since he had died.
Apparently, I was { guilty ### rude ### wrong ### firm } .
All that time I thought he wasn't doing anything with his grandchildren, but he was very actively doing the thing that was most { honest ### important ### normal ### equal } to them.
In Pressure, { everyone ### anyone ### nobody ### somebody } struggled to be the very best.
When women gave birth, they would { have ### like ### compete ### try } to have the baby with the loudest cry.

Because wealth was the index of success, people were { seldom ### always ### hardly ### sometimes } busy making money, with no time for relaxation .

People grew up without { pleasure ### pressure ### work ### happiness } and Meanwhile do anything they liked .
People grew up without always and { must ### need ### could ### dared } do anything they liked .
At school, teachers didn't { know ### find ### recognize ### care } whether students showed up or not.
It was { money ### time ### pleasure ### pressure } that mattered.
No one had the { strongest ### slightest ### most ### smallest } thought of moving forward, either for themselves or for the town.
Some of the young were addicted to { books ### work ### money ### drugs } because of the meaninglessness of their lives.
Then, people in the two towns began asking themselves, What is { pressure ### life ### pleasure ### money } for?
But, just before life in the two towns completely { improved ### failed ### succeeded ### lived } , there came a saint - Mr. Reason.
People in Pressure learnt to be { satisfied ### surprised ### patient ### angry } with what they had, while people in Pleasure began to make plans.
The rain caused the streets to { confusion ### flood ### sink ### crash } and the subway system almost came to a stop.
Many people who were going to work were { forced ### refused ### approached ### gathered } to go home.
Some battled to { order ### pay ### call ### search } a taxi or to get on a bus.
Still others faced the { climate ### scenery ### storm ### burden } bravely, walking miles to get to work.
I { occurred ### promised ### deserved ### happened } to be one of people on the way to work that morning.
I went from subway line to subway line only to find that most { practice ### travel ### process ### service } had stopped.

After making my way through crowds of people, I finally found a subway line that was { running ### cycling ### turning ### rushing } .
Unfortunately, there were so many people waiting to get on the subway that I could not even get down the stairs to the { street ### ground ### floor ### platform } .

I was about to turn off my computer platform I received an email from Garth, my Director : I would like to thank all of you who made the effort and { hardly ### definitely ### absolutely ### finally } went to work .
It is always reassuring , at times like these, when employees so clearly show their { devotion ### permission ### concern ### reaction } to their jobs.
Garth's email was short, but I learned more from that { exact ### urgent ### brief ### humorous } message than I ever did from a textbook.
The email taught me that a few words of { promise ### appreciation ### admiration ### guidance } can make a big difference.
The rainstorm and the traffic { troubles ### signals ### rules ### signs } had made me tired and upset.
But Garth's words immediately { corrected ### supported ### amazed ### refreshed } me and put a smile back on my face.
This young man was still the { smallest ### smartest ### bravest ### biggest } of the class when he entered high school.
He decided to try his best at every { risk ### step ### practice ### match } , and perhaps he could play later.

There was no { idea ### doubt ### way ### need } he wanted the worst player in this close playoff game.
But the young man { won ### tolerated ### scared ### insisted } , and finally the coach, feeling sorry for him, gave in .
Soon, the coach, the players and everyone in the { families ### stands ### corners ### queues } could not believe their eyes.
This little { puzzled ### unknown ### boring ### polite } man, who had never played before, was doing everything right.
The opposing team could not { accept ### believe ### defeat ### stop } him.

After { walking ### riding ### driving ### running } several miles under the burning sun, I stuck out my hand and eventually a truck pulled up .
An old local and two Moroccans got out and { invited ### forced ### commanded ### arranged } me to squeeze in.
Do you know where I can get something to { wear ### watch ### eat ### visit } ?
Nothing for miles , was his reply, followed by an { announcement ### offer ### answer ### excuse } to drive me somewhere.
I { always ### often ### never ### sometimes } pick anyone up.
He told me. You're the first. We { drivers ### hikers ### athletes ### cyclists } have a name for people like you.
He smiled. We stopped in front of a { restaurant ### station ### market ### harbor } .
As we ate, the sky grew dark and { packed ### heavy ### filled ### crowded } with clouds.

Raccoon said that he did not { mind ### like ### accept ### expect } the darkness because he was so smart that he could find plenty of food, even in the dark.

As the other animals { set ### dropped ### took ### turned } off to sleep, one by one, Chipmunk kept arguing.
Finally, the { brightest ### darkest ### first ### last } sunrise ever seen by the animals appeared over the top of the mountain.
They woke up and were { shocked ### upset ### terrified ### amazed } by what they saw and regretted that they hadn't seen the sun earlier.
One day, it started to break through a small hole in the cocoon, but it { shouted ### struggled ### changed ### waved } greatly.
The boy felt { ashamed ### satisfied ### happy ### sad } for the butterfly because he knew it was going to die if it didn't get out.
So he ran into the house and got a pair of { knives ### trousers ### scissors ### shoes } and cut the cocoon a little.

The butterfly crawled around and unable to { walk ### fly ### move ### run } and then it died an early death.

 { without ### by ### with ### for } the struggle, the butterfly couldn't grow, and would pushed fly .
 fly the struggle, the butterfly couldn't grow, and would { seldom ### hardly ### ever ### never } fly .
By trying to help the butterfly, the boy { actually ### gradually ### slowly ### generally } hurt it.
There was one special event that was { informal ### unfair ### illegal ### uncommon } for me.
I spent three or four hours { carrying ### picking ### handing ### bringing } out warm dinner to the homeless out in the streets and then in a homeless shelter not far from the Bay Bridge as well.
I was in high school and at the time my sister was too { young ### active ### selfish ### afraid } to join in.
She wanted to help,34 { however ### but ### yet ### so } she made many chocolate chip cookies for me to35 take and hand out to people .
She wanted to help,34 so she made many chocolate chip cookies for me to35 { enjoy ### eat ### collect ### take } and hand out to people .
When getting to the shelter, I passed out the { papers ### meals ### books ### gifts } .

I told him I had, and his eyes { watered ### shut ### opened ### closed } a little bit and said, No one has42 cookies called me sir in the past 60 years .
I told him I had, and his eyes shared a little bit and said, No one has42 { never ### ever ### still ### yet } called me sir in the past 60 years .
So he was completely moved. It43 { encouraged ### attracted ### shocked ### upset } me.
I explained I had been raised that44 { whichever ### whatever ### whoever ### however } a person's color1 and social position were, he deserved respect.
It { persuaded ### saddened ### frightened ### Moved } me to think that just because he was homeless, no one old him the honor .
It walk me to think that just because he was homeless, no one { handed ### offered ### provided ### promised } him the honor .
It broke my heart. I just didn't understand { what ### how ### whether ### why } no one ever called him sir.
Every { single ### usual ### ordinary ### normal } person deserves to be treated with respect.
Years later, I still carry that memory and the { reality ### class ### truth ### lesson } it taught me.
Sometimes,what we are raised to believe can50 { possibly ### nearly ### really ### Usually } make a difference in someone's life.
Dust is starting to { stick ### happen ### gather ### hide } on the pictures, tables, and even my computer again.
Dirt { orders ### needs ### expects ### considers } to be swept from the floor and pet hair should be cleaned off the couch .

That home is my soul . I spent the morning clearing my soul from top to { back ### side ### bottom ### middle } .
I swept the negative thoughts from my mind and the { harmful ### positive ### healthy ### enjoyable } feelings from my heart.
Worries, anger and fear were { collected ### thrown ### set ### arranged } into the garbage can.
When I was done, I felt { safe ### sad ### calm ### excited } in my home once more.
The house in which I sit may need a lot of { work ### time ### pack ### decoration } but it will have to wait its turn.
The home in which I live is what I am most { bored ### interested ### upset ### concerned } about.
I hope that the same is { suitable ### wrong ### true ### helpful } for you.

I was { delighted ### confused ### excited ### astonished } and asked why.
I didn't fully understand him, { so ### and ### as ### but } I decided to leave the shoes.
Two days later I dropped by from work to { bring ### collect ### see ### return } the shoes.
I found morescratches on each shoe; all the openings were patched by soft red leather; the stitches were twisted with the appearance looking more { ugly ### strange ### lovely ### familiar } and interesting than ever.
I couldn't help praising the master's { skill ### drill ### performance ### strength } .
Another time, my sister's blouse was torn, leaving a large opening. My wife checked it { anxiously ### suddenly ### carefully ### delightedly } , and then said, Let me take it home and skill it .
Another time, my sister's blouse was torn, leaving a large opening. My wife checked it lovely , and then said, Let me take it home and { wash ### iron ### save ### mend } it .
Three days later, seeing it again, I was greatly { puzzled ### disappointed ### surprised ### touched } : all the torn parts took on a look of ice crystal ;attached to it was a snowman made of flowery rags.
I sighed with { anger ### regret ### praise ### care } , It's amazing!
I was { encouraged ### inspired ### moved ### attracted } by that shoemaker.

Her words inspired me more : perfection is impossible to achieve in mend ; patches appear in the { form ### name ### shape ### need } of injury, disability or disease .
Since you can't change the existence of wound, you should not { treat ### accept ### ignore ### expect } people's sympathy by disclosing the wound, which is meaningless.
Just sew the { wound ### pain ### injury ### disability } by patches and produce a most beautiful flower on it, and that is the significance of life.

The parents were telling their daughter to hurry and get into the car, { but ### and ### so ### then } the little girl was still holding the door, waiting for me!
I forgot to tell her how { beneficial ### influential ### anxious ### grateful } I was for her kindness.
I wrote a note saying how much her act of kindness had { strengthened ### broken ### touched ### saved } an old man's heart.
The next day there was a { note ### knock ### invitation ### picture } on my door and it was the little girl and her father.
She was quite { proud ### aware ### afraid ### sure } of her behavior and thanked me.
Then I noticed her mother standing there too. Her parents { admitted ### recognized ### praised ### thanked } me.
From then on when we met in the hallway we always greeted each other,in a friendly { manner ### appearance ### sound ### announcement } .

She wanted to catch a moment in time and { hold ### remove ### find ### cover } it in her heart forever.
I just { decide ### hope ### wonder ### remember } that she carried a lot of those moments with her into Heaven when she passed away at only 55.
Last night I was sleeping lightly { when ### while ### after ### before } I suddenly felt someone near me.
I opened my eyes and saw Mom's { body ### figure ### shape ### shadow } standing in the room, smiling at me.

To me, though, it was { proof ### time ### chance ### belief } that Mom's loving spirit was still watching over me.
To me, it was evidence enough to know that one day I would be { reunited ### buried ### connected ### joined } with her and everyone I have ever loved.
Trust in their love. Know that your own life can be full of { hope ### joy ### love ### surprised } , too.

I decided that I would { pay ### run ### speak ### wait } for elections again in my final year at school--and I would win.

And my biggest { problem ### strength ### worry ### dream } was the faith I had.
I would not allow my { young ### public ### special ### ordinary } appearance to hold me back from putting my best foot forward.
That evening, I { began ### discussed ### announced ### changed } my election plans for the next year.
I realized that girls would have get to know me and recognize that I had the { support ### necessity ### ability ### permission } to speak for them.

In order to learn how to give an election { broadcast ### speech ### performance ### promise } ,I also took a course on successful public speaking .
The day after election,when the head teacher announced I won the second highest number of votes,the students { nodded ### gathered ### cheered ### argued } .
That joy on the faces of all my friends showed me that my success was { only ### still ### almost ### also } theirs .
Suddenly, I realized that I had { achieved ### controlled ### devoted ### developed } much more than I had dreamed of.
I had made many new friends and had helped people { by ### to ### in ### along } the way.

 realize I believed I would work for a few years, get married, stay home and raise a family, so I didn't think the job I took { helped ### required ### expressed ### mattered } that much .
I couldn't have been more { careful ### mistaken ### interested ### prepared } .
I mastered the skills of that beginning level position and I was given the opportunity to move up through the company into different { situations ### choices ### directions ### positions } .
I accepted each new opportunity with the thought, Well, I'll try it; if I don't like it I can always go back to my { easier ### newer ### earlier ### higher } position.
But I was with the same company for the past 28 years, and I've { permitted ### counted ### organized ### enjoyed } every career change I've made.

No matter how badly-behaved I had been, I could tell Grandpa anything and my secrets were { safe ### open ### little ### special } .
It ended up breaking Mrs. Ferguson's kitchen window! We all { jumped ### ran ### cheered ### hesitated } !
He knew we had been { consulted ### questioned ### warned ### bothered } many times about the dangers of playing where we shouldn't.
 { And ### So ### Or ### But } he just listened.
I hate myself for what I did. Is there a way { back ### out ### around ### off } ?
If she knew you { cared ### changed ### quit ### Finished } and you were afraid of her, she would be sad.
I'll bet she wishes you would give her a chance to be { outgoing ### confident ### polite ### understanding } .
It's your decision. Are you planning to { complain ### admit ### pretend ### agree } nothing happened?
Just keep quiet and hide what you're not proud of? I don't know, I { sighed ### laughed ### insisted ### begged } .
I had been { confused ### afraid ### angry ### shocked } that Mrs. Ferguson would stay mad at me, so I ran.
Well, I said, taking a deep breath, One solution is to tell Mrs. Ferguson I'm sorry and offer to fix her { fence ### door ### roof ### window } .
If you call her, asked Grandpa, What's the { strangest ### worst ### fairest ### rudest } that can happen?
I realized that even if she did not accept my { blame ### excuse ### apology ### advice } , it could not be any worse than seeing the disappointment on Mom and Dad's faces .
I realized that even if she did not accept my apology , it could not be any worse than seeing the { tiredness ### fear ### surprise ### disappointment } on Mom and Dad's faces .
I had to think for a moment. Grandpa smiled when he knew I had { checked ### put ### figured ### took } it out.
Doing what's right is not always { easy ### great ### useful ### suitable } , he said, handing me the figured .
Doing what's right is not always disappointment , he said, handing me the { baseball ### phone ### tool ### paper } .
Grandpa did not make me do it. It was always my { problem ### duty ### dream ### choice } .
Choosing to be honest makes others { trust ### reward ### follow ### remember } you and respect you.
He gave me the tools to fix many problems and most of all he showed me I was { modest ### active ### brave ### Friendly } .

Earlier that day I had begged my mother to do something about the { awful ### special ### fascinating ### delicious } lunches that were served at school.
But she { regretted ### agreed ### complained ### refused } because she could not believe the lunches were so bad.
When I turned to Father for help, he would not { comment ### submit ### oppose ### handle } .
By the time we reached home, I had a(n) { conclusion ### plan ### rest ### image } .
At school the next day, I secretly { drank ### spat ### poured ### flowed } my lunch soup into a bottle and brought it home.
Then I { talked ### forced ### sent ### urged } the cook into serving it to Mother at dinner.
The plan worked { terribly ### naturally ### perfectly ### shortly } .
In the years that followed I often remembered the { class ### lesson ### story ### idea } Father taught me.
And on the way to my first small success I found the road { occupied ### smoothed ### blocked ### widened } .
I was busy getting ready to { show ### provide ### follow ### lead } my winter fashions.
I felt so depressed that I was { curious ### doubtful ### determined ### sure } that we would have to cancel the presentation or else show the clothes unfinished.
We worked hurriedly and the showing took place as { usual ### supposed ### scheduled ### unexpected } .
Many of our clothes were only { patterns ### colours ### drags ### scarves } made of heavy cotton cloth.
It was our { meaningful ### common ### ordinary ### unusual } showing that caught the attention of the public, and orders for the clothes poured in .

The girl was surprised when she saw that her boyfriend was { selfish ### foolish ### deaf ### blind } !
So she refused to { marry ### invite ### visit ### teach } him.

You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, { and ### or ### but ### So } by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
I have { vivid ### admirable ### awful ### painful } memories of your childhood.
Of { making ### dressing ### taking ### picking } you up as a rock star .
Of watching you dance { on ### over ### in ### with } nightclothes.
Of your insistence that I make your school lunch { as ### while ### though ### if } I put so much more peanut butter on your sandwiches than anyone else .

 badly , I am happy for you and proud that I played some small role in helping you to { support ### oppose ### have ### follow } a dream .
There is a { plan ### promise ### conflict ### distance } between us now.
It has grown since I first left home, and in the { experience ### process ### situation ### direction } I missed your teenager years.
That { frightens ### touches ### upsets ### comforts } me greatly.
I imagine that you believe we have very little in common--a dancer in the city and a biologist in West Africa---but in you I { hope ### see ### keep ### remember } some of my own dreams realized.
So, on the rare { stages ### vacations ### spots ### occasions } when we see each other, I want to know everything, from your concerns, hopes to delights.
I wish, there were an arm's { width ### height ### length ### depth } between us.
It allows you to { understand ### change ### believe ### appreciate } every moment of life.
It { tells ### reminds ### informs ### suspects } you of something that can easily be forgotten as you run around in your busy life : life is incredibly fragile , and can be taken away in an instant .

I sat there in this hospital room, feeding the man I've seen as { proud ### powerful ### cruel ### serious } and capable in my entire life.
It was both { surprising ### disappointing ### worrying ### satisfying } and frightening.
It felt { bad ### lucky ### good ### strange } to support him, yet part of me wanted to tell him to be satisfying again .
It felt powerful to support him, yet part of me wanted to tell him to be { normal ### common ### ordinary ### special } again .
I wasn't sure if I was ready to { learn ### accept ### express ### explain } the full meaning of it : that my father may satisfying be that powerful and capable person again .
I wasn't sure if I was ready to powerful the full meaning of it : that my father may { always ### seldom ### often ### never } be that powerful and capable person again .
Pain and suffering have visited my family, { as ### because ### so ### since } it will visit all families.
And while we hesitate to { find ### enjoy ### face ### catch } pain and suffering, it has great lessons to good us .
And while we hesitate to satisfying pain and suffering, it has great lessons to { punish ### blame ### teach ### follow } us .
When it { comes ### leaves ### exists ### stays } , it broke these boundaries and turns our world upside down.
We become a { class ### family ### teacher ### party } with all of the others who have known pain and suffering.
And we have another chance to tell what's truly { positive ### difficult ### negative ### important } in our lives.
The { healing ### cooking ### cleaning ### working } hands of time will do their work.
I'm thankful that I've told my { father ### brother ### sister ### mother } everything I've wanted to say to him.
We'll all be { supported ### challenged ### expected ### examined } by this to show more support, care, and love.

No matter what Charlie said to him, Waterworks would always find some { means ### reason ### method ### value } to be sad: I don't have many sweets...my parents didn't buy me that toy... Everything seemed so bad to him.
But Cheerful Charlie wasn't going to be let down , and he kept spending more time with Waterworks, { hardly ### quickly ### constantly ### specially } trying to cheer him up, just as he did with everyone.

He quickly paid for the breakfast, left a { luck ### word ### promise ### action } , bought gas with the change, and headed West.

Smith lives above the McKays and it appears that not only is he a keen gardener, he is also a { fish ### seed ### plant ### newspaper } collector.
Unfortunately for him, the water he sent over his balcony every day ended up on the McKay's, or too often, on the McKays { himself ### itself ### themselves ### herself } .
For the last fortnight, since Smith moved into the flat above us, we have hardly dared to go to our { Bathroom ### kitchen ### bedroom ### balcony } , said Laurence.
She added that it wasn't so much the water falling onto their balcony from Smith watering his plant { which ### what ### that ### whether } bothered them, it was more the way he cleaned his fish tanks.
We'd be { sitting ### exercising ### sleeping ### eating } there happily reading our newspapers, when themselves so much water would come from above that we'd be as wet as if we'd balcony with our clothes on !

Rarely had Laurence seen McKay move so fast. I couldn't { stop ### blame ### ignore ### stand } him.

When he arrived at her house, she reached out her hand and wrapped her { firm ### smooth ### dry ### fresh } old fingers around his arm .
Help me inside, boy, she said. Help me { back ### over ### away ### down } to my bed.
The old woman on the bed tried to { sit ### get ### stand ### wake } up, raising berselfon her elbow .
Water { rolled ### burnt ### burst ### ran } from her eyes and mouth.
The sight of her made Joseph feel { sick ### ill ### unpleasant ### funny } .
I'm { dead ### dying ### living ### alive } , Joseph.
Joseph looked down at the { table ### pen ### paper ### woman } , and then looked out of the window.
Drink Coca-Cola. I want my silver pin to { send ### go ### belong ### come } to my daughter.
Joseph bent his small body over the table and { moved ### drew ### used ### pulled } the pencil slowly across the paper.
I want a { great ### merry ### real ### splendid } Christian burial with lots of singing.
Write that down, too. That's the last - { look ### chance ### opinion ### wish } of a poor old woman.
Here. Bring it here so I can { sign ### write ### remember ### copy } it.
Joseph found the Bible, and, { setting ### hiding ### placing ### lying } the paper inside, laid it next to the bed.

I didn't notice a guy sitting inside a cardboard box. But Nora { did ### was ### has ### had } .
She wasn't even four, but she { pulled ### stared ### pointed ### aimed } at my coat and said, That man's cold.
Daddy, can we take him home? I don't remember my { debate ### reply ### explanation ### expression } .
But I do remember a sudden { light ### funny ### heavy ### magical } feeling inside me.
I had always been delighted at how much my daughter noticed in her { image ### dream ### memory ### world } , whether it was birds flying or children playing.
But now she was noticing { coldness ### kindness ### suffering ### sharing } and beggary.
A few days later, I saw an article in the newspaper about volunteers who picked up a food package from a nearby school on a Sunday morning and { sent ### applied ### devoted ### posted } it to an elderly person.
I signed us up. Nora was { concerned ### curious ### satisfied ### excited } about it.
She could understand the importance of food, so she could easily see how { attractive ### valuable ### creative ### lucky } our job was.
When Sunday came, she was ready, but I had to { encourage ### expect ### allow ### push } myself to leave the house to fetch the food package.
On my way to the school, I fought a(n) { urge ### effort ### hurry ### must } to turn back.
Why do this? { Therefore ### But ### Anyhow ### Instead } , we phoned the elderly person we'd been appointed.
She { requested ### promised ### invited ### thanked } us right over.
Nora ran inside. I { happily ### cautiously ### eagerly ### unwillingly } followed.
Professionals call such a { stay ### visit ### reception ### challenge } a volunteer opportunity .
 { How ### Where ### When ### What } else but as volunteers do you have the opportunity to do something enjoyable that's good for others as well as for yourself ?
 Where else but as volunteers do you have the opportunity to do something { reliable ### fair ### difficult ### enjoyable } that's good for others as well as for yourself ?
Nora and I regularly serve meals to needy people and { collect ### order ### make ### design } clothes for the homeless.
Yet, as I've { had ### felt ### watched ### noticed } her grow over these past four years, I still wonder - which of us has benefited more?
Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside other traditional { subjects ### objects ### customs ### habits } such as maths and languages.
The class sits in a circle with their eyes shut and they count from one to ten: someone starts, the { sweet ### next ### last ### loud } voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side.
The aim of the game is to { look ### see ### find ### listen } for an opportunity to shout out the number without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause .
The aim of the game is to listen for an opportunity to shout out the { name ### person ### number ### treasure } without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause .
On the first try, { all ### few ### most ### none } of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in.
But by the fifth { round ### limit ### sheet ### zone } , they develop a rhythm .
Many teens admit they are { happy ### lonely ### curious ### pleased } and confused, but school is not usually the place to find relief.
The Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness { movement ### class ### course ### approach } It is lonely for 17-19years old students to prepare for university entrance exams .
The Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness round It is { intended ### made ### managed ### applied } for 17-19years old students to prepare for university entrance exams .
The course isn't there to make you happy, Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned pupils, { and ### but ### so ### or } rather to help you discover the ways to become happy.
Cooking a meal together will be one of the class { tests ### exams ### exercises ### homework } , along with improving body language under the course of two professional actresses .
Cooking a meal together will be one of the class lonely , along with improving body language under the { guidance ### lookout ### permission ### cooperation } of two professional actresses .
In the first period, we had to each say something { backward ### positive ### negative ### rude } about another member of the class and about ourselves.
The message is that self-esteem improves { atmosphere ### achievement ### happiness ### score } too.
Research by the school shows it is not the first to start happiness classes and they also exist at some US universities, but are mainly based on positive thinking, using { inspections ### instructions ### motives ### findings } from studies of depression.
Both look every strong and fast. { Therefore ### And ### But ### While } one runner speeds ahead and wins the race.
Some sportsmen can reach great goals such as the achievement of an Olympic gold medal while others { always ### never ### sometimes ### not } live up to their promise.

What kind of preparation before a race or other event makes the { same ### difference ### most ### best } ?
Everyone knows that sportsmen work out to strengthen their { mind ### thought ### bodies ### legs } .
But research shows that strengthening the mind may be just as { important ### interesting ### possible ### correct } .
Careful study shows that the best sportsmen win { mostly ### almost ### partly ### nearly } because they think they can win.
Thinking positive thoughts seems to give possibility for { success ### goals ### win ### failure } in sports.
People who say to themselves over and over, I know I can do this, often find they have the { disadvantage ### advantage ### luck ### hope } to win.
On the other hand, people who think I can't win often { fail ### succeed ### win ### pass } .
One procedure that helps many sportsmen is creating { ideas ### pictures ### thoughts ### movements } in the mind.
They are told to think of each { move ### step ### jump ### place } they must make to win.
Some use pictures that are more fanciful. One skater liked to { think ### imagine ### hope ### wish } a star bursting inside her, move her with energy .
Some use pictures that are more fanciful. One skater liked to pictures a star bursting inside her, { giving ### helping ### filling ### supporting } her with energy .

The water was so 41 { sweet ### bitter ### beautiful ### icy } and he filled his leather canteen so he could bring some back to a tribal elder who had been his teacher.
After a four-day journey he 42 { mailed ### presented ### exported ### picked } the water to the old man, who took a deep 43 gesture ,smiled warmly and thanked his 44 student for the sweet water taken back from the 45 mountain .

The young man 46 { returned ### arrived ### came ### visited } to his village with a happy heart.
He spat it out, saying it was 47 { nice ### terrible ### delicious ### raw } .
It 48 { particularly ### slightly ### obviously ### simply } had become smelly because of the old leather 49 mountain .
It 48 student had become smelly because of the old leather 49 { clothes ### container ### pocket ### boot } .
Why did you 50 { pretend ### decide ### mean ### want } to like it?
The teacher 51 { questioned ### argued ### replied ### supported } , You only tasted the water.
I tasted the 52 { nutrition ### gift ### mixture ### fault } .The water was simply the container for an act of loving--kindness and nothing could be sweeter.
I think we understand this 53 { way ### 1esson ### approach ### title } best when we receive innocent gifts of love from young children.
Whether it's a handmade paper plane or a painting drawn by them, our 54 { natural ### patient ### serious ### curious } and proper response is appreciation because we love the idea 55 pocket the gift .
Whether it's a handmade paper plane or a painting drawn by them, our 54 particularly and proper response is appreciation because we love the idea 55 { within ### beyond ### above ### beside } the gift .
Gratitude doesn't 56 { always ### usually ### sometimes ### often } come naturally.
57 { Luckily ### Unfortunately ### Curiously ### Simply } , most children and many adults value only the thing given 58 rather than the feeling expressed in it.
We should remind ourselves and teach our children about the beauty and purity of feelings and expressions of 59 { regret ### greetings ### behavior ### appreciation } .
After all, gifts from the 60 { heart ### hand ### moustache ### fist } are really gifts of the heart.
A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet.He held up a { note ### photo ### sign ### box } which said: I am blind, please help.
There were only a few { checks ### bills ### banknotes ### coins } in the hat .
He took some change from his pocket and { dropped ### brought ### threw ### slipped } it into the hat .
He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some { news ### information ### words ### themes } .
He put it back so that everyone who passed { by ### away ### up ### out } would see the new words .
There were a lot more people { lending ### collecting ### offering ### donating } money to the blind boy .
That afternoon the man who had { found ### changed ### formed ### made } the sign came to see how things were .
The boy { heard ### sensed ### recognized ### observed } his footsteps and asked, Are you the one who changed my sign this morning ?
The man said, I just wrote the { truth ### story ### issue ### plan } .I said what you said but in a different way.
What he had written was: Today is a beautiful day but I { mustn't ### shouldn't ### wouldn't ### can't } see it.
Do you think the previous sign and the new one were { conducting ### expressing ### discussing ### commenting } the same thing?
Of course both signs { informed ### allowed ### encouraged ### absorbed } people that the boy was blind.
 { Moreover ### Anyhow ### Otherwise ### However } , the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat because of his blindness .
The second sign told people that they were { cheerful ### negative ### lucky ### unfortunate } enough and able to enjoy the beauty of the day , which the boy couldn't .
The second sign told people that they were lucky enough and able to enjoy the { beauty ### brightness ### value ### comfort } of the day , which the boy couldn't .
There are at least two { theories ### titles ### means ### lessons } we can learn from this simple story.
The first is : Be { diligent ### merciful ### grateful ### enthusiastic } for what you have .
Someone else has { more ### less ### better ### worse } .
The second is : Be creative. Think { aloud ### differently ### twice ### positively } There is always a better way.
